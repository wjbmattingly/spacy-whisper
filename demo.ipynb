       " Following his interview with Mrs. Nathan Knathman, I have her role in Famerton Hills on the evening  of January 4th, 1983.  The speaker is the speaker.  Can you tell me your name and where and where you were born?  My name is Sonia Knathman, I was born in Poland.  The city's community, it's very hard to move.  March 28th, 1922.  And what was your name?  Garfield.  Can you tell me something about your life and your life before the war started?  The life was very, you cannot compare to here.  The family was a very, very close-knit family.  Sisters, they have business, you know, all worked when to school, to two schools, you know,  if I had to go to a palace school, you had to go to a religious school.  I went to two schools, they started to play the piano, they still learn a simple.  My family wanted to be a teacher, if not for the woman, but who knows, maybe I would be a religious person.  I was very happy, we didn't have big homes like here, but we were very happy life.  We were very happy, we were very happy.  What did you find with you?  We had a store from the wheat, you don't see stores here.  The partners used to bring all kinds of wheat to us, and we took it to the mills for flour, different wheat for horses, the feed and all kinds.  We took to the mills and brought back flour and we used to sell it.  How about there was no business here, and we looked together.  So it all helped my brother, me when I got all this.  We didn't have any nature to grow up and learn to be somebody, but it was a small town.  How much was your family? How many brothers and sisters did you have?  My oldest brother lives here, I think I have two.  And my youngest.  And my five sisters.  Did you have any other family living in the same town?  Oh, yes.  I had grandparents.  My mother's family lived in Lodge with a city.  My mother's parents came from Lodge.  I used to go with my mother a few times to visit.  How much was your extended family, would you guess, before the war?  Coming all you cousins and sisters, after the war.  Maybe 40 people, or even more, because they were scared at all other things.  And there is Belgium, all over.  How many does people survive the war?  How many people survive what you see?  Four, five, six.  It's from my family, just me, my sister, Nandral.  And I had answered in Paris that they were in Switzerland.  They went to the border.  My father, my uncle, I was in Honeys.  I have two cousins in my life.  A different village.  Can you tell me about your community before the war?  How much was the Jewish community?  Most Jewish community.  I don't remember.  I don't remember how many I forgot.  I should have asked my brother, you know, who remained as.  But it was a Jewish community.  We lived between Polish people, too.  Very few.  Most Jewish people.  How much was the relationship between the Jewish community with them?  The neighbors were good, but not too.  When it came like during the war, nothing.  They wouldn't help you.  I have friends.  I went to school every single day.  During the concentration camp, when they took us.  I know, because people told us they took everything from our house.  So we sent a Polish guy, not just us, the whole,  everybody from the camp.  We were paid in, and given the address.  We didn't say that, not the address.  I know they took everything.  Where's their machinant examinant in the town?  It was.  It was, yeah.  I didn't understand so much, but it was.  Can you recall hearing about anything?  Can you recall one thing just before the war?  There was a guy.  He didn't live too far from us, and he saw me.  Nice living from this business.  And he went to an open store against me.  He was standing in front and told all the farmers mostly in Poland.  They were false.  And he told them not to go to Jewish people to sell to them, to him.  Oh, many incidents, many incidents.  But by us, it was a small city, there were most Jews.  Do you have any idea how many people in the city,  about the war?  The city, as it was made in July?  Yeah, I can count on the other things.  I don't think so 50 people survive.  A few live in Toronto.  A few.  Why do they want to be school, yeah?  In a few armies, yeah.  Maybe 55, I don't even know.  I haven't told you about how many people you give.  Ah, 100,000.  All the parents, our parents, I don't know.  Grandparents, young kids.  I'm proud of the sister, I'm here, I'm proud of you.  Was your family an observant family?  But do you remember what a Friday night was like?  Oh my gosh.  I do, I try to do, but you can compare.  I can come over to that street.  I thought I used to bring, try the night a guy from the synagogue  who used to eat with us, or wear our clothes.  I am, but not to this extent, no.  It's circumstances here, it's different.  You didn't need a car over there, you could walk,  because it's small, and you would have a car,  it cannot exist.  At the beginning when I came here, I made up my mind,  I didn't want to ride for ten.  But I keep crossing my heart, oh no.  I have a vicious spirit.  I don't know, maybe we didn't have a dish washing.  Now we have a dish washing, put a dish washing in.  But I'm used to it, I don't know, maybe I tried to please my parents.  What was your house like?  We had kitchen, and we had another one,  and we had a bedroom.  We had big rooms, very big ones.  We had another one, a smaller one.  And we stopped.  How did you know?  What was the town that sounds like?  Can you describe town?  It looked like, were there many synagogues in the town?  Of course, many round backs in the middle.  I have a, they send me from Israel,  I said, a few times, I say yes.  From our city, there are a few people left over,  and they know they have pictures of everything.  So they send me the issue of being a big synagogue.  I remember my mother used to go.  And then there were little synagogues.  My father went to a different synagogue.  He was a different person.  He belonged to a different synagogue.  This was one of the very big synagogues.  I don't know what they do here.  This is two different schools.  You want to a public school?  Oh, yeah.  And you have to go after that.  And I came home, I had to go to the other one.  I used to know very well.  Even now when I go to synagogue, I often go to work and I can pray.  But I forgot, I used to know by heart.  When you went to public school, what was the language that was spoken?  All the ships, all the ships.  All the ships.  All the ships.  Very few.  So yes, the archaeologists who used to be,  I remember what happened to you.  But I was born.  Biggest cities they have been Jewish too, but they are sleeping.  In your class, how many Christian children were there?  Very few.  Most of them.  The majority of Jews.  Do you want to go to Jewish?  I wish your family very actively at home.  No, no.  Not at all.  My brother, yeah.  He's got a quick script to keep around to.  He belongs in an organization, a Shaman Hatsai.  Was there much?  Yes.  Was there much?  All the many, oh yes, so many organizations.  So many organizations.  I was in school, I remember.  After school, people called us and they were going to talk to us and everything.  My parents were afraid, you know, that they want me to go just to religious school,  not to any organizations.  But your brother was active in this.  Very, very.  He's a very, innowable place.  When I want to know something, I thought I was going to ask him.  What was the culture like in your terms?  Do you remember the many theaters, your theater?  No, not at all.  The most important books.  I don't remember.  I've ever gone to bed without a book.  I never remember Friday, I looked close to the store,  I didn't do nothing.  Friday night after dinner, a book.  I could read two books, I read everybody.  Not just me, everybody.  There was a public library.  Is there any libraries that you used to go every now?  Then I put them under your arm.  They all changed a bit.  Saturday I could finish my whole book.  Because you didn't do nothing.  All the libraries, my brothers to watch,  many times I brought them up.  Everybody wants to read a book to what's...  He took it away from me.  It wasn't that bad.  My parents were religious.  My brother watched all the libraries.  Everybody.  I think everybody from a small town,  in a big city maybe they have different things to do.  But they are once in a while.  I don't think so.  I was even after the first movie.  A movie.  A movie.  I think it's interesting.  Still have any problems with the index?  On the narrow streets?  Yes, before the war.  I visited my grandparents.  My mother.  I was so much.  People were marching.  I don't remember what came up.  I don't remember.  That's what they told you later.  Not to go out because the kids...  I've turned out from the gates.  See who they are.  This was a lot.  Oh yeah, big success.  It was late by us too.  We have a neighbor and he...  He was...  Depends which city?  He said to our poor that he was a Polish pick.  Yeah.  I always...  I always remember.  He told me that I was a Polish pick.  And it was a court and he was put in jail for a whole year.  He didn't do all.  He let them out.  He was a very intelligent guy.  He said to somebody from our house.  What were your plans for the future before the war?  Did you have a teacher?  Yes.  What are the scores?  Do you remember where you were when the war began?  How you heard about it?  Oh, when the war.  I wasn't lost.  My mother left me.  And I wanted to say that it was some a victim by the movement.  It was in a suffering movement.  I remember the blood tension.  I was there as my mother.  My aunt was there.  We went to talk to her.  We were living like so.  Not to you.  Do you remember how the Jewish community felt then?  I heard about something like this.  People ran away.  They ran and they didn't know where some people went.  They went out from the train.  Everybody was a child.  Nobody.  Nobody.  But the dream of a pink lady.  People who were left home in Russia were alive.  Did you go there because you were expected to go to the break out?  No, I was used to this.  There was a thing in my mother went home because she had to talk.  She wanted me to stay because I had an empty.  My grandmother there and I had an uncle's.  How did you get there?  I won't play the back home.  I don't even remember how.  I know some high-wells back home.  But then I can learn a time during the war.  Not as a Jew.  Because I spoke to someone Polish and I don't know Jewish at all.  Nobody would ever ever know me.  They never did.  Then in the beginning it was a bad one.  But then when they closed, they got up.  My grandmother was a my grandmother.  My aunt.  She married me.  She went to the baby.  My mother's, I went there.  My mother gave me food.  I used to have dinner with some children.  I went to the baby.  I was afraid of them.  I didn't know what it means.  Life was nothing.  I went to the train.  I don't know.  I was maybe two or three hours late.  But when the ghetto was only there,  there was a house near the ghetto.  Near the fence.  It was a church.  A church.  And he used to take money.  He was not in just the church.  You saw the German people there.  You put down the fence.  And there was a little room usually in the night.  A lot of people.  And I remember one Saturday night.  We went over the building.  We were ready in the ghetto.  They probably noticed that.  There was a little room.  One gun broke, she came up.  They looked in the room.  There was a little chair.  I lay down.  I sit on the chair and close my eyes.  I opened my mouth.  I thought, I should read you.  I closed my mouth.  I thought I burned.  I already made myself a story.  In case they catch me,  we have a store there in the ghetto.  We have nothing for more to live.  I'm here and I have to go to bring something.  One push, he said, what is this use?  I said no.  They know that I would be young then.  I wouldn't be able to do it.  There are many chickens.  So he opened my books.  And he saw that I have a loose.  And something, if it's dead, they would not touch the Germans.  All not.  They would not touch their friends.  So I told them they didn't do nothing.  They couldn't go in for them.  Because it was the ghetto.  And in the morning I went and I remember that now.  My grandmother stayed there on Saturday morning.  She prayed.  She saw me.  She made the day.  And I brought...  Yeah, but the father closed the ghetto.  I have a sister.  She used to live there.  She was in a German section.  A beautiful section maybe.  She used to go there just as much older than me.  And I said she passed away three years ago.  She came from Russia.  In Toronto.  I used to go.  I stayed by my grandmother.  I used to go there and stay in the line for bread.  It was so far, but I was young to work.  What is it?  It's nothing.  I stayed in the line.  It was a line.  It's very long.  Over there, at least you stayed for a couple hours.  You can get two bread, three bread.  Because it wasn't a German call.  I stayed in front of me.  Lots of people.  There is always police.  I don't know if it was a call or a German.  He took a deal out from me.  She got black hair.  She looked like Jews.  And he took a out.  He said, you the out.  And I was standing in the back.  I said, he would only know.  I'm Jewish, but not him.  I came home with two bread.  I have a coat.  I have nothing to look at.  I didn't want it.  Because they could grab the bread.  Here one bread.  I opened it.  I grew up.  I grew up.  I grew up.  I grew up.  I was working.  I was fortunate.  I was fortunate.  And I went back and forth when they got to us.  I brought my hand.  I had a store from...  I think a lot.  Here they don't have stores like this.  I went to the office from underwear and all kinds of linen.  I took home.  We sold it.  And I brought back different things.  So I went there for quite a few times.  Nobody ever had a recognition.  Never.  Never.  Maybe if I would be older, I would understand what it is.  Maybe I would be afraid.  But I wasn't...  I didn't care.  And then I knew my grandmother had nothing to eat in my end.  It was a little bit.  And at home I brought home.  So I went for quite a few times.  Once I remember I was before the interlodge, the third race.  There is a little time, Koloşki.  So there is a guy.  He took us.  Lots of people there.  He used to take...  I don't remember how much.  He used to sit there, dark, and at night he took over.  Tied.  He came back.  Another thing.  He knew everything.  He had a car.  Three everything.  And there were maybe 50 people on the floor.  We cheered.  I think it's quiet.  And I didn't talk always.  When I was asked...  I thought...  Maybe, maybe, maybe somebody would recognize me.  And I heard a lady said, you know what?  She talks.  I don't think so.  She's closed.  You know?  Yes.  I heard it.  I was supposed to live three hours.  I went to him to the guy.  I said, he should take me into first.  He said, you know, he's not.  He's not.  He's not.  He's not.  He's not.  He's not.  I was not at the time.  I met a girl in the lodge before the ghetto.  And I knew right away.  She's used.  She was a coat.  You could see.  She came from someplace.  There was a gentleman.  I said, I told a guy, maybe, maybe, sit over six feet.  And I saw him.  I went in and out.  The gate was open and I held my own hand.  And I told her to go.  She didn't want to go and she said she had to go sometimes.  Maybe to collect something and he took care of it.  He took the, I don't know where, and I saw.  So I said, I don't know.  So many incidents that...  But then I stayed home.  What happened in your own town in Schmeller after the jailbreak?  When did they commit suicide?  In September 1939.  Yes.  Yes.  The first day came to follow me.  Did you remember what happened when they...  When they came in, I was sitting, I wasn't hungry.  When I lay there when I came.  Oh, they made that ghetto right up.  They closed the store.  Usually, every tour they had a harvest used to come.  And there's a farmer.  We have a store in it was the weeds up to the ceiling.  No, they didn't.  They closed it.  Because they know it's...  They don't want us to do business.  They open Saturday.  They know everybody.  It was really this.  So we didn't have from what we...  So my brother, my sister...  My father said, don't do it.  My brother, I remember used to say, he's always said, I don't want it there.  I want it there.  My father went in the second room after he came from Sinalot in the down.  He slept.  And we bought...  Which from the farmers, we got money, bought and sold everything.  They thought, with this, they can...  You know, we vanish.  And then they closed in this thing.  And they will live there.  On the corner of the cities where they took all the juice, they now get to the minute.  There's not many incidents.  So...  Then we didn't have nothing to do.  We made a get-to-by-ass.  I remember everybody used to go, I forgot, I have to call...  They know.  So then we used to read books and books.  I remember, that's all we...  But then one day, it was summer.  They...  They had given all the...  All the young people should come.  And the...  Dante, like it was...  It's a small city.  It's a...  It's a...  You know, how you call it, you think?  Like Dante, you go square.  Yeah.  Everybody should go.  So what did I know I went?  And my youngest sister, she's now in Ireland.  Like I'm here now, I take a little coat, a spring coat, and they came with...  A cast,  a trox.  And if somebody didn't want to go, they have big dogs, general shepherds.  I remember my sister, my youngest sister.  We stayed there for hours, hours.  Brought something, past she wouldn't bring it.  And the German came and hit her so many times.  And I screamed, she should go away.  He hit the worms.  Afterward, after the...  And during any concentration came, when I met her, because she went later.  She told me, she got four weeks, weeks.  But she came home, my mother could call the warden.  Also, they have those things in her hands here.  She wanted to give us morning or something.  And then afternoon, they took us away to Skarzysko.  Me, my sister.  And the man they took and the different.  My brother was to Skarzysko, but Skarzysko was a munishing actor.  And there were three verbs, A, B, and C.  My brother, they took to A, and they took to B, my sister.  We were lucky because we worked for potatoes.  This is our new.  The first day they took us to barracks.  And what did we know?  There were a few guys, I mean, all that from us.  They were young too.  But then, to me, they were old, because we were so young.  They had money.  I found out later that they went to the ship from the whole concentration camp.  They asked him, they want to have a good job.  Yeah, they pay money, and they send them.  But we didn't know nothing.  The following day, they told us to go out, make a circle.  And they came three masters from A munishing.  It was a munishing actor.  And my master, he was a told stoch.  He had milk from potatoes.  From those potatoes, they made flakes.  In those flakes, we put it in a suit.  Like, when you put a suit in the suit, the suit got thick.  At the burn, it went through steam.  So he came and took me.  I took my sister because they wanted to be together.  And I didn't know what he's going to do with us.  Where he's going to take us.  Later on, we find out we were lucky.  Some girls from all time, they were a munishing lady in last month.  And the work where I was, and B, was very poor.  There were my brothers, it was different.  It was in time.  So you could go, you could buy something, sell something.  You could sell a portion of bread.  You could buy a shoe, buy a shoe, but you couldn't do it.  And then we got, in the beginning, we didn't have what to do.  So there was a big hole.  The mill was there already.  But there was a big hole, just like a barn, from wood.  Later on, the potatoes used to, when they came with the eggs,  the potatoes they put in there.  But this guy who took us was a folk stoch.  All the guys, very old.  I think he was then a 70 years or no.  He was very good to us.  I remember there were benches, wooden benches.  And we laid there as a feast to come in twice a day to ask,  see what we're doing.  When we saw him, we took up wrongly slip, not into him.  And I went back crying and crying and crying.  He got that one and he told us,  but I yeargoh his wife died.  One of his sons is in the, at the part of this.  One son is an assassin.  One son is a master, a derbar, and the amish.  What can he do?  We should be young, we survive, and everything.  Then when a few weeks later, the potatoes came,  we worked for this 12 hours a day.  When the shifts changed from Sunday to Monday,  we have to work 18 hours.  We have potatoes to eat.  And we put the flakes in the sack, in paper sack.  That's what algae is.  If the flakes came out from the sack, we have to put them down,  a certain amount of weight should be.  Then there are special people who saw the sex,  and they put them, send them to different groups.  We got paper, we didn't have any sheets like here.  We took home sex, so it was paper.  I got my bank account that I went in in the sack,  and I said, you know, we took the papers, we took the paper,  we'd string, and that's what we are.  I found out that paper was worth, and this now,  because I found out that my brother is in the sack,  and my brother is not the kind of guy you should go,  you should grab, and that's not.  He would use that, nothing.  So we got two pieces of paper.  We ate one portion, and one portion.  The other portion we took to my brother.  The other portion we took to my brother.  I went to my brother, I got seven portions of that.  I sold that, and we bought a whole bread, it's better.  He would not have cut potatoes in this.  My brother was very nice to us,  and I went into the steam to take a shower,  I don't like how I couldn't go.  I cannot, he gave up the thing.  Why the good?  I brought you, he should have brought a little,  he said, I cannot stand it.  I had so little friends here.  How can I eat my cake?  So what could I do?  But we still continue.  One Sunday, I came home.  We went Sunday morning, and we came home,  and I was late, because...  I said to my sister, you know what?  Nate, looks so good.  I didn't know, he saw it, he was so much.  Whatever I know, I said, he looks so good.  I didn't know what he ate from us to the soup.  So I'll lay the run, I ask somebody to eat from his well.  So we went, I asked my master,  we got Polish people who wanted to study.  I want to ask him, if he can be my favourite,  my brother, my brother, he is, he's a tall guy,  but he said he's going to talk to our master to the gentleman,  but to him I couldn't talk, I didn't know, maybe he would scream,  I wonder if he jumped in the wrong way,  he said he was going to be here.  So he arranged everything, I don't know,  my brother worked on me.  One day, when I worked, I sought to do the main grudging.  But there was a good watching, we shared it,  it was different, otherwise you wouldn't survive on an island.  And then we were there for two years,  in 1942 to 1944.  So then when the Russian came to Skarżysko,  the part they got to transfer.  This was much further, much further.  In all the ammunition, everything, so they took us,  my brother, they took some place, I don't know.  And I looked before, there, when they were supposed to evacuate us,  I'm big, a German, I remember Schriftfield, I said,  if you see somebody, he didn't like it, he could shut them,  he tells somebody to shoot.  And my brother was cleaning the new island  because we were supposed to take apart everything.  And the new was going, and he put his hand here,  he got the sauce here, and he threw it in his throat.  And we took him to a doctor, what kind of doctor?  We have a little doctor, and he put him,  I don't know how he is, I don't know, this is something,  an ammunition, and they took him, they took us here,  they took us to the Chesterheim.  And we were there a few days, in our German,  our master sent for us.  What few days just, it's simple, we stayed there,  I think, three quarters of our army in Chesterheim.  And we worked the same by the meals.  And there was, I didn't know nothing about my sister,  I didn't know nothing about my brother, I just don't know my sister.  When I came to Chesterheim, I heard people from Kielcidis  who is not father, this is very tricky,  and that's from us.  So I asked them if they know somebody from my hometown,  and they told me that I have to assist us.  And the Halkian from there, they sent to work.  So I went in, he was a Jewish guy, it wasn't so far,  it was a large field, very nice.  And I asked them if I had my sister, they said,  yeah, there are everything, there are everything,  my older sister, and I heard this.  The Halkian found out, in the following day,  he said the first transport that he bring,  they used to bring every day, people from there.  So they brought me to assist us.  I was with my sister, I went all night again,  and I thought, what's the situation?  Did you all be happy?  I can have a hug.  And they used to bring transports from all of it,  because they ran away from the rush.  And they brought in a transports,  I used to go every day, my sister looked in the barracks  to the man, maybe I found my brother,  maybe I found my brother.  One day I found my brother.  This is brother who was with you?  I didn't even know that, I was younger than him.  I found my brother there.  Everybody, everybody who had a sauce,  they couldn't believe it, five feet.  So they were not, maybe three quarters of a year.  Then the Russian came again, the first day.  It took us out again to Germany.  We didn't have, we didn't have,  we didn't have to go, not to go,  but everybody went, I was standing with maybe,  I don't know, 300 women in the German vatsters  to go off the train.  I saw Germans from front, the red cross.  We could run away, they wouldn't do nothing to us.  We could be free the same night,  because we were shooting, other, just...  Nobody ran away, mother and father.  The men they took to different trains and asked to different,  they told us they were going to give us a bread  and some dynos and everything.  We went to Germany and I don't think so.  A quarter was alive after that.  A quarter maybe was alive from all of us people.  Good could run away, so easy.  The same night, the Russian came in there.  Same night.  It took us to Bergenbund, me and my sister.  I have a method, I'm not running, I'm not volunteer.  The last ones are the first...  The first...  The girls, they took, they shaved them, they didn't close.  We didn't see them coming out, we came in at the frontway,  we went out, when they came to us they didn't have any clothes.  Anymore.  So we took a shower, they didn't shave us already.  We had the same clothes, it was in January.  So we stayed there in Bergenbund, it was in Bergenbund.  Bergenbund was a...  They say, Fenichtegumski.  You didn't have work there.  They catch you to work, but nothing.  We used to carry bags to this, nothing.  I remember one time they caught me to work in my younger sister.  It was in January in Poland, it was very cold, very cold.  So she carried a bed, I and that in the hand, I crossed into the bed.  She said to me, I cannot go anymore, I cannot go anymore.  I took a hand in my mouth and I blown, they got...  So I took a scarf, I don't know what's happening, I put it in my hand,  she said, but we stayed there a month.  Oh, we stayed another few weeks, we left.  So they sent us out from Bergenbund, I remember two times, I think.  There was two, Fenichtegumski, nothing, there was no work there.  The barracks were in the basement, in the basement, the main, there were the slurred.  We stayed there a month or two, from there we marched to Burga.  This is by Dachau.  There was, Burga was, plain factor in Burga.  In Burga already they took us to barracks, it was clean,  and I could go for food, I mean, but five o'clock we have to get up,  they took us with buses, to the factory, to the planes in Augsburg, in the forest.  I thought I was on a job now, I'd make lots of money.  They took, I was always told, my age, so they took me in another year,  she's now in Toronto, to paint the plane, two years inside to put everything,  small paints, this wasn't for us, there was no very good thing, they were attacked.  She used to make, she used to paint, the tap was brown, I used to paint blue, the body.  Then I used to make spots with a, like a pistol, the paint with a,  here a spot, here a spot like, they are in the forest, they shouldn't show it,  truth, brown, here brown, here a spot, here a, so I used to work with them for a month.  Over there, the cops told us, when you work with this, they used to have,  they give you special food and everything, but I was glad you went away,  we got a portion bread and everything, after this, this was our...  March, like a dead march.  There were many girls, they couldn't walk anymore, they couldn't,  we were all full, you know, we saved a piece of bread, we saved this,  and we got a cover, we marched towards Dachau, Allah, there was a,  it was a bit cramped, it was already in April, in April,  in my system, my undisistered, couldn't walk anymore, so I hold on, my shoulder at the time,  and she couldn't, couldn't it?  So, a horse and a boga came and they took the, the sick people, it was already at cross,  it was already at the end of April, no, I could finally remember,  that's why she couldn't walk, we slept on a ditch, the ditches are big,  three times in this house, very deep, in the water was there,  and we got a cover, and it was pouring, it's,  a sluptor on my, we got drenched wet, and when we got up,  my sister was already very sick, she couldn't walk,  so there was a horse and boga, in the two, can they took it to Dachau to hospital?  This wasn't fucking Dachau, it was all over,  us three walked, and my undisistered, got sick, she walked,  and we both, me, my undisistered, carried him, by hand.  Finally we came to Allah, and we heard already that it's not,  it's already the Americans are here already, we knew already,  it's the end, because they didn't hit us, they didn't shoot us.  So, I slept on a table because I heard it was already,  and my sister went away to the hospital, and I was just very sick,  and the following day my undisistered, wanted to hospital, he got typhus.  The shooting was there, night and day, night and day,  a two-day slider, the America's gym, a two-day slider.  Then many people died, many people, because they give us food,  and for my undisistered, not you, not you.  So, when the Americans came, they said,  my undisistered, she got better, so I asked,  about my sister, that they found out that she's Dachau in the hospital.  She was, she was better.  Then they took us, from Allah, we stayed there not too long,  there was a big, we stayed, and they took us from there,  I think, to Fremont, this is Bamiunik, because there was very good thing  that it was, and I was very sick.  In Fremont, this was a two-course area, and there was,  I remember, during the war, 7,000 soldiers, German soldiers,  so big, not barracks, big buildings,  and the front was smaller building for all the officers in the high and elite,  so there was 80 women there, so we stayed there.  And from there, the people used to go already from different camps.  With a list, it's shown the front because it was a quarantine,  because the tide was big.  With a list, who is alive?  My youngest sister said, I liked the fall,  she said that she was dreaming that my brother alive.  I remember, she said, I said, maybe,  the fall of the Agal camp feels from Krakow,  and he showed us all this, and it's on her brother's nose.  And he said that he's going to two different camps,  and see people, and if somebody from us want to go see him,  you're more than welcome, he's going to take us.  So my youngest sister went with my older,  and we took them, they had my brother there, this was,  and she had many years of Austrian boven.  My brother was, they went out from Buchenwald,  1600 people, there was 104, 155 people here.  This, so then they came back, and you all fell away.  When I saw my brother, it was both with Agal.  So, good looking, I scaled it.  But they, they have nurses there,  they feed him, they give him medication.  He was sick for a very long time.  I remember they came to, they caught assessments,  and they brought him in, and my brother was laying in a better,  he said, come on, come on, hit him.  It's funny now, when I think back, even down from,  but he crawled.  He could hit, he was, before the war, I don't know,  laid him, how many pan could he weigh now?  150 pan.  150 pan, he was 80 pan, then.  Yeah, he was told, so he crawled, crawled,  and he went to the facility, and he couldn't even go back,  to his back, because it's too much energy,  he couldn't make it.  So, then he used to go, my brother, I went to,  lots and lots of hospitals.  Nothing's coming, he's okay.  I'm going to go back a little bit, back to,  when you were, before you were taking out your fillage.  What happened to the schools in the family?  They are closed right away.  Yeah, they're closed.  Of course, people were afraid to go.  They were very nice youth communities.  Very nice.  Nice and friendly, I'm right to people, to Israel now.  To my home town, yes?  Did you need a camparitan to get food and to work?  Yeah, yeah.  Who worked?  They didn't let us.  There wasn't a working time, business.  Everybody was told, business, most.  But as we didn't have a thread, my brother came here,  he didn't have a thread.  He was business, everything was business.  What happened to the Starbucks?  You know, the Germans came in today, let's you worship it more?  No.  All when they, they cut people to the roof,  my father had a beer.  Not peace, just to be cut.  They didn't let them.  They see somebody with those locks, they cut them, they hit them.  Once, they heard from the Germans, they came in.  My father went to the city, I don't know, he went to pray, he came home.  And on the way home, two Germans holding,  and tried to cut these beer and they hit me.  Somebody, I was in the house, my brother.  Somebody came to me and said, they cut me father.  I went over and out, and tried to protect my father, they hit us.  He told my father, let me show you what could be here.  Oh, it was.  It was on the beer again.  When they, once they get out, did you stay in your home,  or were you sent to another house?  No, they took me, they took with them before they fell.  My mother was there.  I met her later in the camp, she told me.  She was to the last day, to the end.  When they took the ghetto, then they took all the Jewish people,  or slushed out of them, they took boggies, they told them they were going to horse boggies,  they told them they were going to take him to concentration camps.  My sister, my younger sister, my little brother, and my mother.  My father, my mother, my sister, screamed to my sister.  She was the young, nothing else.  Because the people were done, they knew, they heard, they took,  they should push my sister down from the go, go hide something,  go because if not you go with us.  And somebody gave me regards from me, and took.  And this was in love, this is my panic, I think.  That is so my mother holding my little brother, my sister.  This woman was in camp with my sister, and then they killed her too,  because she was still old like my mother couldn't even let him go.  This was the last thing that I heard.  My father ran away, and they shot him.  My younger sister, Hussula.  She wasn't there, she wasn't there.  So you're talking about the pulse, we have neighbors, the Inuitas.  My father begged him to take my sister, when the German took over  the house, she went to our neighbor.  She stayed there in the stable with cows, with everything.  They didn't let her one night, she went from one stable to the house.  So she went to the house, this is in Kelsen at Farfah Mass.  So she went with other, there was a Jewish president who had,  so they took all the people, they sent them there.  They didn't want to keep it.  You talk about the poor.  Did you call, was there a youth match in the ghetto?  Oh, by a, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.  How did they operate?  I had an nephew, he's in Toronto, he was hiding by the pulse.  Where is she?  So who was already 15 times thrown in the shot?  He was young then, he was his brother.  They forced you.  What could you do? You have to go with the dogs.  You didn't want to go, they bite you.  And they took you there, let's go.  I wasn't to the last minute, I wasn't to come here before.  There's so much of an enthral movement.  By ask, yeah, scarves, scarves?  I have a friend in scarves, scarves.  She came from Lorsch, from the big cities,  when they formed the ghetto, lots of people came to small towns.  They thought the Germans wouldn't go.  So I met her there by ask.  She walked the ammunition,  we start the one-barre, the ammunition, the definition.  She used to steal the ammunition.  Nobody knew.  Nobody knew.  I know two guys, the repolishment,  they belong to the underground, there, because...  The reactor is there, it's scarves, it's scarves.  For us.  So she, smaller, unannounced now, finished, and she gave it.  We didn't know, nobody, from us.  One day she didn't come home from work.  The repolishment, the city sink, all night,  polished some, the Germans some.  The cutter, steal it, get shot at.  For that, she shot at her, but it was an underground.  That's what, since then, she found out it was an underground.  Was there much smuggling in the ghetto to get food in?  Oh, yeah.  The plants who worked there, smuggling, and they sold,  who got...  People who had money, people who came  from the St. Paul, scarves, there's a pan.  And this was out of the town, the factors.  So they could take everything, because they came before us,  but they asked, they took it without nothing.  So we came in, for us, it was very poor, the skin, very poor skin.  Oh, many, many.  The first time, and they shoot us, the second day,  but few guys, young guys, they went to be to school,  or several of them, they ran away.  They brought them, they followed in their calculations.  Oh, so...  Why didn't he have a word to go?  Two people had any idea of the death camp,  did they, did anyone ever get back to your town?  What was happening?  It was before they took us, a guy ran away from a train.  He's brother, look by us, in the same building.  And he said that he had a sword,  something but nobody believes.  Remember my father had a Bible, he said,  no, God has nothing, love to have you.  No, not to us.  Then we'll start hearing lots of things,  because they took from us, people, they took my brother,  they sent him to be a livestock, for work.  Then when he came, he told us horrible stones.  Yeah, but still nobody could believe it.  I myself don't believe that.  There are so many nice people by the last day,  they took them, I don't know.  There was a guy, they had factories from...  Long beyond, different, very religious,  and they took him, I don't know, I saw him.  They were married already,  we were always single again.  And he came in when I saw him, I gosh, I couldn't believe it.  They didn't live like that, I don't know.  They couldn't exist, couldn't exist.  If I would be by myself, I would live in this for two months.  But I was with my sister, she's more energetic than me,  because I didn't care.  I remember, I dreamed the first week,  I just wanted to be with my brother.  If they're there, I wouldn't be there.  They take you away from a home, you raise,  you love each other so much.  No, one person, and they were alone, they couldn't survive.  Very hard.  In the camp, the first place you were taken to,  I can't remember, I was taken to...  Very hard, very hard.  What could the actual living conditions like the barracks  and the food, do you?  The food, very poor, couldn't it?  If you don't, people who worked in the ammunition,  they try to make a portion bread,  or a little soup, by washing clothes for somebody.  By doing certain chores for somebody who had no money,  there was a deal, she was my agent from Alhantar,  and the master, my master from the hospital,  took a sheet of clean dishes,  she was like a queen, to clean the house,  she got food and everything that she used to bring food.  She died there, oh my gosh, if you were sick,  they'd take you out to the forest, but I was lucky.  I went in Scottish, and I went to wash myself there,  there were a few things, water, and I fainted.  They took me to work in Scottish megatimes.  My brother was still there,  because we saved him, when he was there, we were never ready.  But when he was in the ammunition,  he was working, we saved the eight, one portion bread,  for both of us.  So I got sick, and I took him there, my brother,  found out, I remember right now, he saw his portion bread,  and he brought some place, all.  He brought him, bro.  And there, the hospital was salty, dead people.  I would never do it at all, so I could leave.  I said, I beg your please eat.  He said no, please, they didn't let him in,  but somehow he begged the nurse, they let him in.  Next to me was I came from Scottish, she died, it was not.  But from our work,  be where I was, there were Jewish people,  the ship from the camp, there was a woman, a woman,  I remember like that, she came to visit me,  and I came to her today, I just told my husband a few months ago.  I think our master, the folks there,  sent her.  Because she wouldn't go, what did she have?  She came, she asked me, she told them to give me medication  or something, and I survived.  She brought me home, I remember she came to visit me,  she asked me how I...  This is something like an angel would come to you.  This filthy would straw every minute they took out dead bodies.  And I went home with all the girls who worked in this camp,  took me home, and I went to work,  my sister worked for me, I could work, I couldn't work.  But I have to go, if not, they will be ships,  they catch you in barang, sick, they came lots of times.  But they brought me home, a few days later I couldn't go down from that.  But somebody heard that it's going to be,  they're going to come, the Germans received, somebody's sick.  So two girls came from the night ship, they slept during the day.  They took me out in the love of somebody.  They took me out.  It does two girls, one girl, is in Toronto and one is in southern America, two sisters.  They took me out, they used to be friends with my brother.  They used to come to us, they came, they took me out.  After they left, the inspection, they took me out.  See, there is, I don't know, I see there is a God.  And I believe, strongly, really, sometimes I say,  there would be a God, there are many people,  listen, people got killed for what?  What?  A child do wrong.  But then there are miracles, you see, everywhere, you see, there are miracles in miracles.  Did the issue you're clothing there, or did you?  No, what kind of God?  You have to, you sold, you brought a lot of clothes, I couldn't.  Once they brought clothes, from other that people probably,  they shot in an eagreot to alkim.  And they put them on the ground, it was, I don't remember, sauna, outside,  and they told us to go out from all the barracks.  They said, they come to three, later I found out,  everybody go and grab, but I couldn't go out.  I didn't care.  Some I sister cried, cried, because I know friends of my there and out  and brought three fatheresses of this, all they could live,  or pens or shoes, socks, anything, from that people, of course.  But I told my sister, she's now no one, I said,  I couldn't go, I said, I was right, I was, you know,  I kind of like this, you don't care, you don't care,  if you are alive or if you don't, they brought in,  I remember, brought in clothes, my sister brought to the recess of this,  and she said, you see, you could go, you could help,  my brother, I said, listen, I get my breath,  I send it to my brother, I go on a gilletay,  but they don't give us clothes, no.  People saw this, so, when we walked in scarletous comets,  so the pills from the potatoes, we threw it out,  this one for the pigs.  So people went through, and they tried to grab us to eat,  all the other, the other Germans, they could shot him.  They beat him to death, they did nothing,  from when I worked at an ice ship.  So if you have a potato, as we took, we got in big canister soup.  So it was 11 o'clock, we got a break,  and we could drink the soup, and nobody from us, they eat the soup.  Of course, the pills they got potatoes, they saw they have a piece of bread,  and the soup, it was impossible to eat.  Of course for us, but for our not for others.  So I used to take a canister soup into the barracks at night.  I remember, and I came in, it was 11 o'clock until everybody was souping.  The pills ran out from the crew, from the...  and everybody had it, put everybody out of the crew.  When I worked at a night ship, I almost did it, I almost did it.  There were Jewish policemen, you know, I know already, and I told them.  They were good, and they were bad too, it was very bad, one day.  They sent them away later.  I came with two men, half soup, and the woman, by us, we have soup.  I told them to give us the soup.  So they give us the soup, so I took a canister here.  Not a canister, they don't like this.  And I put a coat over, nobody sees, I hold here, and I go like this.  So this policeman was standing by, and he was standing with us, he slept me long, and twice.  He slept me so hard, but I begged him, and I cried.  I went back to the room.  But then he went away, so...  But most of the Jewish people, they let you through, because they know.  I think that we're in church, if you're actually lack of record, out of the stairs, is it carposts?  No, by us.  It wasn't...  They arranged from each baroque one should vouch, or by the devil, of course.  But us was a small, not too big.  Of course it was a lack of this, it was a human, a rena, that only she was.  Did they keep the sex as separate, the men through the women, or the individual?  There was one baroque, if somebody was rich, I mean, to the father.  Our baroque was divided.  There was, she was a Jewish, she was taking care, very intelligent woman.  The Terhaz bin, staying in the baroque, it was divided.  And there were certain barons, you met, you could live there.  Or if you have money, you reach, you have a boyfriend, you could.  Very few, very few, who could think of a tenka?  Did you have trouble getting to see your brother, getting in to...  No, don't do that.  Night, or night?  Don't do that.  We arranged so that one, if my brother works through the day, I'll stay with him the day,  my sister went at night, because we changed ships.  We used to walk together, but when I brought my brother, so...  One was always with my brother, we watched it.  Not that he needed watching, but we cooked something for him, we see.  That he could eat.  Did you count the names of any of the Germans who were in charge of the day?  Can't you read?  Of course.  He had not lived in Krausek.  They shot one, one, they shot him.  Or going home, he was with Polish woman.  They said the party doesn't say, well, nobody knew.  I remember, it was 1942, because maybe 1943,  we didn't have work by us in the middle of...  Our master, his name is Laskovski, was...  He was a folkstarch.  He sent us to the Ammonition Factory for a couple months, until the potato sugar.  And he lied, or heard, and I don't even recall by whom I walked.  Ammonition, they sent us to transport.  Many used to work by this.  So they took us to pick up a crate of Ammonition, even farmen could pick this.  I worked there for the months.  He wouldn't call us big.  Before the war, they told us they took on a roll,  a special wedding or work, they wrote this.  But then they got a labour for nothing.  The men used to work.  But when we didn't have work, they sent us there.  So they took us to create.  We worked there, I don't know.  Six weeks, I don't know even if two months.  I don't think so, could survive two months.  So that's why I know I worked by...  I think herring was...  Two inches, four inches, and polished centimetre.  The shells, all kind of.  They used to put in a crate.  This is very heavy.  We used to carry this.  Pick this up, put this on the table.  And people used to check it.  It could have a syphilis, it could have a gout or not.  You were there for how long?  In the first year.  First came, probably years.  Almost two years.  When the Russian came in,  they came here, they vacated.  That was a four four.  Yeah.  When you were there, they took you by train,  but did you have a two-go train?  Train, because it's train, they lock.  How long were you there? How long were you on a train?  On us trains.  They took us several times on trains.  To Germany took us long, because it's not big.  It's from Skorysko, ours maybe.  But from chance to hunt up to Germany took us long.  They gave us some bread, for things.  And days, days, remembering,  Bertsburg, Germany.  Between Stadard and Nitasalt.  And they were the bombs fell all over.  All of them, we prayed it.  We didn't care.  We died, but days, days took us.  Because you couldn't go all the time.  And then they let us out from the train, on a box.  In Germany, I cannot recall where it was.  And I saw a silver place,  but they didn't throw bombs.  They glared, we waited to them, they should throw bombs.  They did.  It was already at the end.  How many people were in a train car?  We were all.  You couldn't move, tied.  And then we could go.  We couldn't see, we couldn't.  So many ways.  We didn't try any sanitary facilities,  was there a bucket?  No.  We had a cellar tied in the forest at night.  It's the same.  When they brought us to Bergen-Beldinger,  we had one room.  A big room.  Let us stay, lay at night during the day.  If you want to stay out of your vehicle,  just a small space station.  A little small space.  I wasn't too long.  I was one month, but I was.  There you couldn't stay long.  We came in, got the worst of it.  People who are already there for a long time,  they know how to do it.  You could see a pass by Bergen-Beldinger,  you see mountains shoes, mountains of clothes,  mountains of clothes.  I went back after the war,  and I went back.  Not that I wanted, but I had the look for his money.  I was like a little bit.  That's why I would never go back to Berlin.  Never go back to Berlin.  What was the sanitation like in Pelsinger and the food?  What food?  Bergen-Beldinger?  They give you, they start giving coffee.  Until it came down.  Bergen-Beldinger was no, nothing.  You could get a piece of bread for today, nothing.  There were so many people there,  and never there.  It was in January.  It took us out.  A few came.  It was great for two to three hours.  The freezing weather, it's good, we were young then.  So we could take it.  Or Bergen-Beldinger was dead.  Dead came. Dead.  We were the just amongst us.  And for Bergen-Beldinger you worked?  Perkheim.  In Burga, I was in Bergen-Beldinger,  Burga, Turkheim.  In Alaq.  In Idakh.  Perkheim-Beldinger was divorced.  We could run away.  So easy.  Did many people run away?  Not two.  Just two.  Did anybody talk about what was happening to you?  Do you remember what you were thinking when?  They told us we were going to work in Germany  and they gave us bread and food and everything.  Usually.  And I saw, from the front of me, the Germans run away.  I saw.  One German lost the ammunition.  What did he carry?  Nothing.  A rifle or something.  I remember the office.  It's a picture.  I saw ambulances from Russian front.  They cut us off.  Or they let them through.  We could run away.  Easy.  The Russians can...  The same night they can do.  We saw it on the arm.  Bergen-Beldinger was dead.  Dead came.  I was going to shoot him and stick him.  Man.  We were afraid to go out.  If you went out, they kept you to work.  I told you the fact that my sister...  I won't give her many times.  But I saw her.  I was old.  You ran away.  The death march.  Were you fed at all?  Were you walking?  How did you get food when you were a march?  Of course I was.  When they took my sister, she was sick.  But they gave her my...  Her?  I know, the few years later, when I was a friend of my sister,  she had a big potato, a big potato.  She had a big potato.  She said, she was a little blind.  She had a big potato.  She had a big potato.  She had a big potato, but it was nothing left.  Everybody grabbed her.  No. People had grass.  Yeah.  Mosque...  Hungarian.  Polish nut.  I don't know.  I saw she took her grass.  She didn't have food.  I think when we went...  I think a piece of bread I'm not in the college will give you about...  They didn't have food.  They didn't have food.  Because it was already at the end.  I saw that it crossed the wall, but they didn't.  But they didn't shoot us.  They didn't shoot us.  Because it was at the end.  But who left food?  They did come to the Indian age.  They were not allowed to shoot.  No, no.  They got off.  Of course they don't.  So a few, not one.  When we slept in the hall,  I don't know the ditch.  The water was already there.  And it was pouring and they were standing, watching us.  In the rain.  Not a rain, it was...  I thought we would get up and nobody would do a life.  Because it's...  After this I remember that so many people got sick.  And then we marched the day, we marched at night.  And at night you see so many people marching back and marching for them.  They could fall.  So many thousands of people.  What was their purpose in marching?  Did you know how long it took?  How long can you march?  How long can you march?  My brother left cooking about 1500, 1600 people.  There are 1450 people.  Can't do.  Lebanon.  My brother was alive because...  It's something...  Like I said, a miracle.  He was a guy and a pole.  He came down.  He saw him, he did...  He didn't have the water. So he went down.  So he got a guy.  German probably.  This was in German.  He got 10 cigars.  He gave it to my brother.  10 cigars.  My brother, maybe he felt sorry for him because my brother had his hand with bandages.  So there are still people who had money and he will have a bread or something.  So that was his alive.  From the 10 cigars.  So 10 cigars what do you have?  Is there any kind of religious activity in the camps?  And the barracks where you were?  In the beginning when they took us out of Lebanon, it was Eastern.  Lots of people remember.  So they didn't eat bread.  So they took it.  So they showed them bread.  So they took it.  So they took it.  I could never eat meat.  Meat.  They didn't give us meat.  Who would say meat?  Special bars was a very good one.  But they put maybe horse meat in the soup sometimes.  I could not give it.  I could not.  Was there a difference between the SS and the barrack guards?  Yes.  Oh, a big hulk cross.  But then we have them from Ukraine.  Oh, they were so good.  They didn't have the wrong arguments at the end.  They had no idea.  They had no idea.  The Ukrainians were there.  And then tell me about how you were liberated when you were at the end of the war?  It was the Americans.  Oh, Americans.  We had shots and this was another.  This is near Dacha.  In my two sisters, very hospital and I was with my sister.  They were sleeping on a table because they said the restores were ready.  Fifteen everything.  I didn't share that with her, but I like when I'm clean.  So with her the shots on my two legs, through the barracks, and after people got killed.  There was a hospital.  They made for my barrack a hospital.  In the morning, we didn't see one day.  The women, the Germans, all, there were big shots as they couldn't even look at them.  We didn't see anybody.  Finally, the following day, they still didn't come in the same day.  And I saw nurses, nurses, all of them.  I forget it.  Fingerlings.  And they came around and they were sitting in the dirt that you made sick.  The dirty, I don't know if I could go there.  She went to the bacteria.  She mocked us to meet her.  But then there was a French doctor.  I used to know this name, but I don't remember.  I have to ask my friends.  He did so much.  And there was a French archive from the concentration to...  Maybe he worked in a hospital, he looked good.  And he took a few deals from us who were not sick to help them.  When the American people came in and I knew.  And there was a home, barak home, maybe 316 people.  So I wasn't another unit doctor to tell us to go away and assist him.  And nothing, what did I know?  So I saw he...  Give a shot, I said it myself.  He couldn't.  Yeah, but he told me to do certain things I didn't.  And he was an intern.  This guy was an intern.  I hope they did.  Not too many people.  I have a Jewish guy, a French.  He was a few French people, but he did.  And then the one thing that they did wrong was they gave...  Right away, food, food.  Lots of people died, they couldn't take it.  I'm going to give you a little food, you can take it.  I'm going to just stay on that after these after you."

      "[00:13:17.400] I think everybody from a small town,  in a big city maybe they have different things to do.  \n",
      "[00:13:22.400] But they are once in a while.  \n",
      "[00:13:25.400] I don't think so.  \n",
      "[00:13:26.400] I was even after the first movie.  \n",
      "[00:13:29.400] A movie.  \n",
      "[00:13:30.400] A movie.  \n",
      "[00:13:31.400] I think it's interesting.  \n",
      "[00:13:35.400] Still have any problems with the index?  \n",
      "[00:13:39.400] On the narrow streets?  \n",
      "[00:13:42.400] Yes, before the war.  \n",
      "[00:13:44.400] I visited my grandparents.  \n",
      "[00:13:48.400] My mother.  \n",
      "[00:13:50.400] I was so much.  \n",
      "[00:13:52.400] People were marching.  \n",
      "[00:13:54.400] I don't remember what came up.  \n",
      "[00:13:56.400] I don't remember.  \n",
      "[00:13:57.400] That's what they told you later.  \n",
      "[00:13:59.400] Not to go out because the kids...  I've turned out from the gates.  \n",
      "[00:14:03.400] See who they are.  \n",
      "[00:14:04.400] This was a lot.  \n",
      "[00:14:06.400] Oh yeah, big success.  \n",
      "[00:14:10.400] It was late by us too.  \n",
      "[00:14:13.400] We have a neighbor and he...  \n",
      "[00:14:17.400] He was...  \n",
      "[00:14:18.400] Depends which city?  \n",
      "[00:14:20.400] He said to our poor that he was a Polish pick.  \n",
      "[00:14:24.400] Yeah.  \n",
      "[00:14:25.400] I always...  I always remember.  \n",
      "[00:14:27.400] He told me that I was a Polish pick.  \n",
      "[00:14:30.400] And it was a court and he was put in jail for a whole year.  \n",
      "[00:14:34.400] He didn't do all.  \n",
      "[00:14:36.400] He let them out.  \n",
      "[00:14:37.400] He was a very intelligent guy.  \n",
      "[00:14:39.400] He said to somebody from our house.  \n",
      "[00:14:43.400] What were your plans for the future before the war?  \n",
      "[00:14:48.400] Did you have a teacher?  \n",
      "[00:14:51.400] Yes.  \n",
      "[00:14:52.400] What are the scores?  \n",
      "[00:14:56.400] Do you remember where you were when the war began?  \n",
      "[00:14:59.400] How you heard about it?  \n",
      "[00:15:01.400] Oh, when the war.  \n",
      "[00:15:03.400] I wasn't lost.  \n",
      "[00:15:04.400] My mother left me.  \n",
      "[00:15:06.400] And I wanted to say that it was some a victim by the movement.  \n",
      "[00:15:11.400] It was in a suffering movement.  \n",
      "[00:15:14.400] I remember the blood tension.  \n",
      "[00:15:17.400] I was there as my mother.  \n",
      "[00:15:19.400] My aunt was there.  \n",
      "[00:15:21.400] We went to talk to her.  \n",
      "[00:15:23.400] We were living like so.  \n",
      "[00:15:25.400] Not to you.  \n",
      "[00:15:27.400] Do you remember how the Jewish community felt then?  \n",
      "[00:15:32.400] I heard about something like this.  \n",
      "[00:15:37.400] People ran away.  \n",
      "[00:15:39.400] They ran and they didn't know where some people went.  \n",
      "[00:15:43.400] They went out from the train.  \n",
      "[00:15:47.400] Everybody was a child.  \n",
      "[00:15:50.400] Nobody.  \n",
      "[00:15:52.400] Nobody.  \n",
      "[00:15:53.400] But the dream of a pink lady.  \n",
      "[00:15:58.400] People who were left home in Russia were alive.  \n",
      "[00:16:05.400] Did you go there because you were expected to go to the break out?  \n",
      "[00:16:11.400] No, I was used to this.  \n",
      "[00:16:13.400] There was a thing in my mother went home because she had to talk.  \n",
      "[00:16:18.400] She wanted me to stay because I had an empty.  \n",
      "[00:16:21.400] My grandmother there and I had an uncle's.  \n",
      "[00:16:24.400] How did you get there?  \n",
      "[00:16:29.400] I won't play the back home.  \n",
      "[00:16:32.400] I don't even remember how.  \n",
      "[00:16:35.400] I know some high-wells back home.  \n",
      "[00:16:38.400] But then I can learn a time during the war.  \n",
      "[00:16:42.400] Not as a Jew.  \n",
      "[00:16:45.400] Because I spoke to someone Polish\n",
      "[00:16:45.400] and I don't know Jewish at all.  \n",
      "[00:16:50.400] Nobody would ever ever know me.  \n",
      "[00:16:52.400] They never did.  \n",
      "[00:16:55.400] Then in the beginning it was a bad one.  \n",
      "[00:16:59.400] But then when they closed, they got up.  \n",
      "[00:17:04.400] My grandmother was a my grandmother.  \n",
      "[00:17:08.400] My aunt.  \n",
      "[00:17:09.400] She married me.  \n",
      "[00:17:11.400] She went to the baby.  \n",
      "[00:17:14.400] My mother's, I went there.  \n",
      "[00:17:17.400] My mother gave me food.  \n",
      "[00:17:19.400] I used to have dinner with some children.  \n",
      "[00:17:24.400] I went to the baby.  \n",
      "[00:17:29.400] I was afraid of them.  \n",
      "[00:17:32.400] I didn't know what it means.  \n",
      "[00:17:35.400] Life was nothing.  \n",
      "[00:17:38.400] I went to the train.  \n",
      "[00:17:43.400] I don't know.  \n",
      "[00:17:45.400] I was maybe two or three hours late.  \n",
      "[00:17:48.400] But when the ghetto was only there,  there was a house near the ghetto.  \n",
      "[00:17:56.400] Near the fence.  \n",
      "[00:17:58.400] It was a church.  \n",
      "[00:18:00.400] A church.  \n",
      "[00:18:01.400] And he used to take money.  \n",
      "[00:18:03.400] He was not in just the church.  \n",
      "[00:18:06.400] You saw the German people there.  \n",
      "[00:18:11.400] You put down the fence.  \n",
      "[00:18:13.400] And there was a little room usually in the night.  \n",
      "[00:18:17.400] A lot of people.  \n",
      "[00:18:19.400] And I remember one Saturday night.  \n",
      "[00:18:24.400] We went over the building.  \n",
      "[00:18:27.400] We were ready in the ghetto.  \n",
      "[00:18:31.400] They probably noticed that.  \n",
      "[00:18:33.400] There was a little room.  \n",
      "[00:18:35.400] One gun broke, she came up.  \n",
      "[00:18:40.400] They looked in the room.  \n",
      "[00:18:41.400] There was a little chair.  \n",
      "[00:18:43.400] I lay down.  \n",
      "[00:18:45.400] I sit on the chair and close my eyes.  \n",
      "[00:18:47.400] I opened my mouth.  \n",
      "[00:18:49.400] I thought, I should read you.  \n",
      "[00:18:53.400] I closed my mouth.  \n",
      "[00:18:55.400] I thought I burned.  \n",
      "[00:18:57.400] I already made myself a story.  \n",
      "[00:18:59.400] In case they catch me,  we have a store there in the ghetto.  \n",
      "[00:19:04.400] We have nothing for more to live.  \n",
      "[00:19:06.400] I'm here and I have to go to bring something.  \n",
      "[00:19:10.400] One push, he said, what is this use?  \n",
      "[00:19:13.400] I said no.  \n",
      "[00:19:14.400] They know that I would be young then.  \n",
      "[00:19:17.400] I wouldn't be able to do it.  \n",
      "[00:19:19.400] There are many chickens.  \n",
      "[00:19:20.400] So he opened my books.  \n",
      "[00:19:22.400] And he saw that I have a loose.  \n",
      "[00:19:24.400] And something, if it's dead, they would not touch the Germans.  \n",
      "[00:19:27.400] All not.  \n",
      "[00:19:28.400] They would not touch their friends.  \n",
      "[00:19:30.400] So I told them they didn't do nothing.  \n",
      "[00:19:32.400] They couldn't go in for them.  \n",
      "[00:19:34.400] Because it was the ghetto.  \n",
      "[00:19:37.400] And in the morning I went\n",
      "[00:19:37.400] and I remember that now.  \n",
      "[00:19:40.400] My grandmother stayed there on Saturday morning.  \n",
      "[00:19:43.400] She prayed.  \n",
      "[00:19:44.400] She saw me.  \n",
      "[00:19:45.400] She made the day.  \n",
      "[00:19:46.400] And I brought...  \n",
      "[00:19:48.400] Yeah, but the father closed the ghetto.  \n",
      "[00:19:51.400] I have a sister.  \n",
      "[00:19:53.400] She used to live there.  \n",
      "[00:19:55.400] She was in a German section.  \n",
      "[00:19:57.400] A beautiful section maybe.  \n",
      "[00:19:59.400] She used to go there just as much older than me.  \n",
      "[00:20:01.400] And I said she passed away three years ago.  \n",
      "[00:20:04.400] She came from Russia.  \n",
      "[00:20:06.400] In Toronto.  \n",
      "[00:20:09.400] I used to go.  \n",
      "[00:20:11.400] I stayed by my grandmother.  \n",
      "[00:20:13.400] I used to go there and stay in the line for bread.  \n",
      "[00:20:16.400] It was so far, but I was young to work.  \n",
      "[00:20:20.400] What is it?  \n",
      "[00:20:21.400] It's nothing.  \n",
      "[00:20:22.400] I stayed in the line.  \n",
      "[00:20:23.400] It was a line.  \n",
      "[00:20:24.400] It's very long.  \n",
      "[00:20:26.400] Over there, at least you stayed for a couple hours.  \n",
      "[00:20:29.400] You can get two bread, three bread.  \n",
      "[00:20:31.400] Because it wasn't a German call.  \n",
      "[00:20:34.400] I stayed in front of me.  \n",
      "[00:20:36.400] Lots of people.  \n",
      "[00:20:37.400] There is always police.  \n",
      "[00:20:40.400] I don't know if it was a call or a German.  \n",
      "[00:20:42.400] He took a deal out from me.  \n",
      "[00:20:44.400] She got black hair.  \n",
      "[00:20:45.400] She looked like Jews.  \n",
      "[00:20:46.400] And he took a out.  \n",
      "[00:20:47.400] He said, you the out.  \n",
      "[00:20:48.400] And I was standing in the back.  \n",
      "[00:20:50.400] I said, he would only know.  \n",
      "[00:20:53.400] I'm Jewish, but not him.  \n",
      "[00:20:56.400] I came home with two bread.  \n",
      "[00:20:59.400] I have a coat.  \n",
      "[00:21:01.400] I have nothing to look at.  \n",
      "[00:21:02.400] I didn't want it.  \n",
      "[00:21:03.400] Because they could grab the bread.  \n",
      "[00:21:04.400] Here one bread.  \n",
      "[00:21:05.400] I opened it.  \n",
      "[00:21:06.400] I grew up.  \n",
      "[00:21:07.400] I grew up.  \n",
      "[00:21:08.400] I grew up.  \n",
      "[00:21:09.400] I grew up.  \n",
      "[00:21:10.400] I was working.  \n",
      "[00:21:11.400] I was fortunate.  \n",
      "[00:21:12.400] I was fortunate.  \n",
      "[00:21:13.400] And I went back and forth when they got to us.  \n",
      "[00:21:18.400] I brought my hand.  \n",
      "[00:21:20.400] I had a store from...  \n",
      "[00:21:23.400] I think a lot.  \n",
      "[00:21:25.400] Here they don't have stores like this.  \n",
      "[00:21:28.400] I went to the office from underwear and all kinds of linen.  \n",
      "[00:21:33.400] I took home.  \n",
      "[00:21:35.400] We sold it.  \n",
      "[00:21:36.400] And I brought back different things.  \n",
      "[00:21:39.400] So I went there for quite a few times.  \n",
      "[00:21:42.400] Nobody ever had a recognition.  \n",
      "[00:21:45.400] Never.  \n",
      "[00:21:46.400] Never.  \n",
      "[00:21:47.400] Maybe if I would be older, I would understand what it is.  \n",
      "[00:21:52.400] Maybe I would be afraid.  \n",
      "[00:21:54.400] But I wasn't...  \n",
      "[00:21:56.400] I didn't care.  \n",
      "[00:21:57.400] And then I knew my grandmother had nothing to eat in my end.  \n",
      "[00:22:01.400] It was a little bit.  \n",
      "[00:22:02.400] And at home I brought home.  \n",
      "[00:22:05.400] So I went for quite a few times.  \n",
      "[00:22:10.400] Once I remember I was before the interlodge, the third race.  \n",
      "[00:22:17.400] There is a little time, Koloşki.  \n",
      "[00:22:21.400] So there is a guy.  \n",
      "[00:22:23.400] He took us.  \n",
      "[00:22:24.400] Lots of people there.  \n",
      "[00:22:25.400] He used to take...  I don't remember how much.  \n",
      "[00:22:28.400] He used to sit there, dark, and at night he took over.  Tied.  \n",
      "[00:22:32.400] He came back.  \n",
      "[00:22:33.400] Another thing.  \n",
      "[00:22:34.400] He knew everything.  \n",
      "[00:22:35.400] He had a car.  \n",
      "[00:22:36.400] Three everything.  \n",
      "[00:22:37.400] And there were maybe 50 people on the floor.  \n",
      "[00:22:41.400] We cheered.  \n",
      "[00:22:42.400] I think it's quiet.  \n",
      "[00:22:46.400] And I didn't talk always.  \n",
      "[00:22:49.400] When I was asked...  I thought...  \n",
      "[00:22:52.400] Maybe, maybe, maybe somebody would recognize me.  \n",
      "[00:22:55.400] And I heard a lady said, you know what?  \n",
      "[00:22:59.400] She talks.  \n",
      "[00:23:00.400] I don't think so.  \n",
      "[00:23:01.400] She's closed.  \n",
      "[00:23:02.400] You know?  \n",
      "[00:23:03.400] Yes.  \n",
      "[00:23:04.400] I heard it.  \n",
      "[00:23:05.400] I was supposed to live three hours.  \n",
      "[00:23:09.400] I went to him to the guy.  \n",
      "[00:23:11.400] I said, he should take me into first.  \n",
      "[00:23:13.400] He said, you know, he's not.  \n",
      "[00:23:15.400] He's not.  \n",
      "[00:23:16.400] He's not.  \n",
      "[00:23:17.400] He's not.  \n",
      "[00:23:18.400] He's not.  \n",
      "[00:23:19.400] He's not.  \n",
      "[00:23:21.400] I was not at the time.  \n",
      "[00:23:24.400] I met a girl in the lodge before the ghetto.  \n",
      "[00:23:27.400] And I knew right away.  \n",
      "[00:23:29.400] She's used.  \n",
      "[00:23:30.400] She was a coat.  \n",
      "[00:23:33.400] You could see.  \n",
      "[00:23:34.400] She came from someplace.  \n",
      "[00:23:35.400] There was a gentleman.  \n",
      "[00:23:37.400] I said, I told a guy, maybe, maybe, sit over six feet.  \n",
      "[00:23:44.400] And I saw him.  \n",
      "[00:23:45.400] I went in and out.  \n",
      "[00:23:46.400] The gate was open and I held my own hand.  \n",
      "[00:23:49.400] And I told her to go.  \n",
      "[00:23:52.400] She didn't want to go and she said she had to go sometimes.  \n",
      "[00:23:55.400] Maybe to collect something and he took care of it.  \n",
      "[00:23:59.400] He took the, I don't know where, and I saw.  \n",
      "[00:24:02.400] So I said, I don't know.  \n",
      "[00:24:05.400] So many incidents that...  \n",
      "[00:24:08.400] But then I stayed home.  \n",
      "[00:24:11.400] What happened in your own town in Schmeller after the jailbreak?  \n",
      "[00:24:15.400] When did they commit suicide?  \n",
      "[00:24:19.400] In September 1939.  \n",
      "[00:24:24.400] Yes.  \n",
      "[00:24:25.400] Yes.  \n",
      "[00:24:26.400] The first day came to follow me.  \n",
      "[00:24:29.400] Did you remember what happened when they...  \n",
      "[00:24:35.400] When they came in, I was sitting, I wasn't hungry.  \n",
      "[00:24:38.400] When I lay there when I came.  \n",
      "[00:24:40.400] Oh, they made that ghetto right up.  \n",
      "[00:24:43.400] They closed the store.  \n",
      "[00:24:46.400] Usually, every tour they had a harvest used to come.  \n",
      "[00:24:49.400] And there's a farmer.  \n",
      "[00:24:51.400] We have a store in it was the weeds up to the ceiling.  \n",
      "[00:24:55.400] No, they didn't.  \n",
      "[00:24:56.400] They closed it.  \n",
      "[00:24:57.400] Because they know it's...  \n",
      "[00:24:58.400] They don't want us to do business.  \n",
      "[00:25:00.400] They open Saturday.  \n",
      "[00:25:01.400] They know everybody.  \n",
      "[00:25:02.400] It was really this.  \n",
      "[00:25:04.400] So we didn't have from what we...  \n",
      "[00:25:06.400] So my brother, my sister...  \n",
      "[00:25:10.400] My father said, don't do it.  \n",
      "[00:25:14.400] My brother, I remember used to say, he's always said, I don't want it there.  \n",
      "[00:25:18.400] I want it there.  \n",
      "[00:25:19.400] My father went in the second room after he came from Sinalot in the down.  \n",
      "[00:25:24.400] He slept.  \n",
      "[00:25:25.400] And we bought...  \n",
      "[00:25:27.400] Which from the farmers, we got money, bought and sold everything.  \n",
      "[00:25:31.400] They thought, with this, they can...  \n",
      "[00:25:34.400] You know, we vanish.  \n",
      "[00:25:37.400] And then they closed in this thing.  \n",
      "[00:25:40.400] And they will live there.  \n",
      "[00:25:43.400] On the corner of the cities where they took all the juice, they now get to the minute.  \n",
      "[00:25:49.400] There's not many incidents.  \n",
      "[00:25:59.400] So...  \n",
      "[00:26:03.400] Then we didn't have nothing to do.  \n",
      "[00:26:06.400] We made a get-to-by-ass.  \n",
      "[00:26:07.400] I remember everybody used to go, I forgot, I have to call...  \n",
      "[00:26:11.400] They know.  \n",
      "[00:26:14.400] So then we used to read books and books.  \n",
      "[00:26:21.400] I remember, that's all we...  \n",
      "[00:26:24.400] But then one day, it was summer.  \n",
      "[00:26:31.400] They...  \n",
      "[00:26:33.400] They had given all the...  All the young people should come.  \n",
      "[00:26:37.400] And the...  Dante, like it was...  \n",
      "[00:26:41.400] It's a small city.  \n",
      "[00:26:43.400] It's a...  \n",
      "[00:26:46.400] It's a...  \n",
      "[00:26:49.400] You know, how you call it, you think?  \n",
      "[00:26:51.400] Like Dante, you go square.  \n",
      "[00:26:53.400] Yeah.  \n",
      "[00:26:54.400] Everybody should go.  \n",
      "[00:26:56.400] So what did I know I went?  \n",
      "[00:26:58.400] And my youngest sister, she's now in Ireland.  \n",
      "[00:27:02.400] Like I'm here now, I take a little coat, a spring coat, and they came with...  \n",
      "[00:27:09.400] A cast,  a trox.  \n",
      "[00:27:15.400] And if somebody didn't want to go, they have big dogs, general shepherds.  \n",
      "[00:27:20.400] I remember my sister, my youngest sister.  \n",
      "[00:27:23.400] We stayed there for hours, hours.  \n",
      "[00:27:28.400] Brought something, past she wouldn't bring it.  \n",
      "[00:27:31.400] And the German came and hit her so many times.  \n",
      "[00:27:33.400] And I screamed, she should go away.  \n",
      "[00:27:35.400] He hit the worms.  \n",
      "[00:27:37.400] Afterward, after the...  \n",
      "[00:27:38.400] And during any concentration came, when I met her, because she went later.  \n",
      "[00:27:42.400] She told me, she got four weeks, weeks.  \n",
      "[00:27:45.400] But she came home, my mother could call the warden.  \n",
      "[00:27:48.400] Also, they have those things in her hands here.  \n",
      "[00:27:52.400] She wanted to give us morning or something.  \n",
      "[00:27:55.400] And then afternoon, they took us away to Skarzysko.  \n",
      "[00:27:59.400] Me, my sister.  \n",
      "[00:28:01.400] And the man they took and the different.  \n",
      "[00:28:04.400] My brother was to Skarzysko, but Skarzysko was a munishing actor.  \n",
      "[00:28:09.400] And there were three verbs, A, B, and C.  \n",
      "[00:28:13.400] My brother, they took to A, and they took to B, my sister.  \n",
      "[00:28:19.400] We were lucky because we worked for potatoes.  \n",
      "[00:28:26.400] This is our new.  \n",
      "[00:28:28.400] The first day they took us to barracks.  \n",
      "[00:28:30.400] And what did we know?  \n",
      "[00:28:32.400] There were a few guys, I mean, all that from us.  \n",
      "[00:28:35.400] They were young too.  \n",
      "[00:28:37.400] But then, to me, they were old, because we were so young.  \n",
      "[00:28:41.400] They had money.  \n",
      "[00:28:44.400] I found out later that they went to the ship from the whole concentration camp.  \n",
      "[00:28:49.400] They asked him, they want to have a good job.  \n",
      "[00:28:52.400] Yeah, they pay money, and they send them.  \n",
      "[00:28:54.400] But we didn't know nothing.  \n",
      "[00:28:56.400] The following day, they told us to go out, make a circle.  \n",
      "[00:28:59.400] And they came three masters from A munishing.  \n",
      "[00:29:04.400] It was a munishing actor.  \n",
      "[00:29:07.400] And my master, he was a told stoch.  \n",
      "[00:29:10.400] He had milk from potatoes.  \n",
      "[00:29:13.400] From those potatoes, they made flakes.  \n",
      "[00:29:16.400] In those flakes, we put it in a suit.  \n",
      "[00:29:20.400] Like, when you put a suit in the suit, the suit got thick.  \n",
      "[00:29:27.400] At the burn, it went through steam.  \n",
      "[00:29:30.400] So he came and took me.  \n",
      "[00:29:33.400] I took my sister because they wanted to be together.  \n",
      "[00:29:36.400] And I didn't know what he's going to do with us.  \n",
      "[00:29:38.400] Where he's going to take us.  \n",
      "[00:29:40.400] Later on, we find out we were lucky.  \n",
      "[00:29:43.400] Some girls from all time, they were a munishing lady in last month.  \n",
      "[00:29:50.400] And the work where I was, and B, was very poor.  \n",
      "[00:29:55.400] There were my brothers, it was different.  \n",
      "[00:29:58.400] It was in time.  \n",
      "[00:30:00.400] So you could go, you could buy something, sell something.  \n",
      "[00:30:03.400] You could sell a portion of bread.  \n",
      "[00:30:05.400] You could buy a shoe, buy a shoe, but you couldn't do it.  \n",
      "[00:30:09.400] And then we got, in the beginning, we didn't have what to do.  \n",
      "[00:30:16.400] So there was a big hole.  \n",
      "[00:30:18.400] The mill was there already.  \n",
      "[00:30:20.400] But there was a big hole, just like a barn, from wood.  \n",
      "[00:30:27.400] Later on, the potatoes used to, when they came with the eggs,  the potatoes they put in there.  \n",
      "[00:30:33.400] But this guy who took us was a folk stoch.  \n",
      "[00:30:36.400] All the guys, very old.  \n",
      "[00:30:38.400] I think he was then a 70 years or no.  \n",
      "[00:30:42.400] He was very good to us.  \n",
      "[00:30:45.400] I remember there were benches, wooden benches.  \n",
      "[00:30:49.400] And we laid there as a feast to come in twice a day to ask,  see what we're doing.  \n",
      "[00:30:56.400] When we saw him, we took up wrongly slip, not into him.  \n",
      "[00:30:59.400] And I went back crying and crying and crying.  \n",
      "[00:31:03.400] He got that one and he told us,  \n",
      "[00:31:07.400] but I yeargoh his wife died.  \n",
      "[00:31:11.400] One of his sons is in the, at the part of this.  \n",
      "[00:31:18.400] One son is an assassin.  \n",
      "[00:31:22.400] One son is a master, a derbar, and the amish.  \n",
      "[00:31:26.400] What can he do?  \n",
      "[00:31:29.400] We should be young, we survive, and everything.  \n",
      "[00:31:35.400] Then when a few weeks later, the potatoes came,  we worked for this 12 hours a day.  \n",
      "[00:31:43.400] When the shifts changed from Sunday to Monday,  we have to work 18 hours.  \n",
      "[00:31:52.400] We have potatoes to eat.  \n",
      "[00:31:56.400] And we put the flakes in the sack, in paper sack.  \n",
      "[00:32:01.400] That's what algae is.  \n",
      "[00:32:04.400] If the flakes came out from the sack, we have to put them down,  a certain amount of weight should be.  \n",
      "[00:32:12.400] Then there are special people who saw the sex,  and they put them, send them to different groups.  \n",
      "[00:32:18.400] We got paper, we didn't have any sheets like here.  \n",
      "[00:32:22.400] We took home sex, so it was paper.  \n",
      "[00:32:28.400] I got my bank account that I went in in the sack,  and I said, you know, we took the papers, we took the paper,  we'd string, and that's what we are.  \n",
      "[00:32:41.400] I found out that paper was worth, and this now,  because I found out that my brother is in the sack,  and my brother is not the kind of guy you should go,  you should grab, and that's not.  \n",
      "[00:33:00.400] He would use that, nothing.  \n",
      "[00:33:04.400] So we got two pieces of paper.  \n",
      "[00:33:09.400] We ate one portion, and one portion.  \n",
      "[00:33:21.400] The other portion we took to my brother.  \n",
      "[00:33:28.400] The other portion we took to my brother.  \n",
      "[00:33:51.400] I went to my brother, I got seven portions of that.  \n",
      "[00:33:57.400] I sold that, and we bought a whole bread, it's better.  \n",
      "[00:34:00.400] He would not have cut potatoes in this.  \n",
      "[00:34:03.400] My brother was very nice to us,  and I went into the steam to take a shower,  I don't like how I couldn't go.  \n",
      "[00:34:15.400] I cannot, he gave up the thing.  \n",
      "[00:34:20.400] Why the good?  \n",
      "[00:34:22.400] I brought you, he should have brought a little,  he said, I cannot stand it.  \n",
      "[00:34:29.400] I had so little friends here.  \n",
      "[00:34:31.400] How can I eat my cake?  \n",
      "[00:34:33.400] So what could I do?  \n",
      "[00:34:35.400] But we still continue.  \n",
      "[00:34:37.400] One Sunday, I came home.  \n",
      "[00:34:40.400] We went Sunday morning, and we came home,  and I was late, because...  \n",
      "[00:34:47.400] I said to my sister, you know what?  \n",
      "[00:34:51.400] Nate, looks so good.  \n",
      "[00:34:53.400] I didn't know, he saw it, he was so much.  \n",
      "[00:34:58.400] Whatever I know, I said, he looks so good.  \n",
      "[00:35:01.400] I didn't know what he ate from us to the soup.  \n",
      "[00:35:04.400] So I'll lay the run, I ask somebody to eat from his well.  \n",
      "[00:35:09.400] So we went, I asked my master,  we got Polish people who wanted to study.  \n",
      "[00:35:18.400] I want to ask him, if he can be my favourite,  my brother, my brother, he is, he's a tall guy,  but he said he's going to talk to our master to the gentleman,  but to him I couldn't talk, I didn't know, maybe he would scream,  I wonder if he jumped in the wrong way,  he said he was going to be here.  \n",
      "[00:35:42.400] So he arranged everything, I don't know,  my brother worked on me.  \n",
      "[00:35:49.400] One day, when I worked, I sought to do the main grudging.  \n",
      "[00:35:54.400] But there was a good watching, we shared it,  it was different, otherwise you wouldn't survive on an island.  \n",
      "[00:36:03.400] And then we were there for two years,  in 1942 to 1944.  \n",
      "[00:36:15.400] So then when the Russian came to Skarżysko,  the part they got to transfer.  \n",
      "[00:36:27.400] This was much further, much further.  \n",
      "[00:36:31.400] In all the ammunition, everything, so they took us,  my brother, they took some place, I don't know.  \n",
      "[00:36:39.400] And I looked before, there, when they were supposed to evacuate us,  I'm big, a German, I remember Schriftfield, I said,  if you see somebody, he didn't like it, he could shut them,  he tells somebody to shoot.  \n",
      "[00:36:53.400] And my brother was cleaning the new island  because we were supposed to take apart everything.  \n",
      "[00:36:59.400] And the new was going, and he put his hand here,  he got the sauce here, and he threw it in his throat.  \n",
      "[00:37:08.400] And we took him to a doctor, what kind of doctor?  \n",
      "[00:37:10.400] We have a little doctor, and he put him,  I don't know how he is, I don't know, this is something,  an ammunition, and they took him, they took us here,  they took us to the Chesterheim.  \n",
      "[00:37:22.400] And we were there a few days, in our German,  our master sent for us.  \n",
      "[00:37:30.400] What few days just, it's simple, we stayed there,  I think, three quarters of our army in Chesterheim.  \n",
      "[00:37:39.400] And we worked the same by the meals.  \n",
      "[00:37:44.400] And there was, I didn't know nothing about my sister,  I didn't know nothing about my brother, I just don't know my sister.  \n",
      "[00:37:57.400] When I came to Chesterheim, I heard people from Kielcidis  who is not father, this is very tricky,  and that's from us.  \n",
      "[00:38:05.400] So I asked them if they know somebody from my hometown,  and they told me that I have to assist us.  \n",
      "[00:38:16.400] And the Halkian from there, they sent to work.  \n",
      "[00:38:22.400] So I went in, he was a Jewish guy, it wasn't so far,  it was a large field, very nice.  \n",
      "[00:38:28.400] And I asked them if I had my sister, they said,  \n",
      "[00:00:00.000] yeah, there are everything, there are everything,  my older sister, and I heard this.  \n",
      "[00:38:39.400] The Halkian found out, in the following day,  he said the first transport that he bring,  they used to bring every day, people from there.  \n",
      "[00:38:52.400] So they brought me to assist us.  \n",
      "[00:38:54.400] I was with my sister, I went all night again,  and I thought, what's the situation?  \n",
      "[00:39:00.400] Did you all be happy?  \n",
      "[00:39:02.400] I can have a hug.  \n",
      "[00:39:06.400] And they used to bring transports from all of it,  because they ran away from the rush.  \n",
      "[00:39:14.400] And they brought in a transports,  I used to go every day, my sister looked in the barracks  to the man, maybe I found my brother,  maybe I found my brother.  \n",
      "[00:39:25.400] One day I found my brother.  \n",
      "[00:39:28.400] This is brother who was with you?  \n",
      "[00:39:31.400] I didn't even know that, I was younger than him.  \n",
      "[00:39:35.400] I found my brother there.  \n",
      "[00:39:39.400] Everybody, everybody who had a sauce,  they couldn't believe it, five feet.  \n",
      "[00:39:46.400] So they were not, maybe three quarters of a year.  \n",
      "[00:39:49.400] Then the Russian came again, the first day.  \n",
      "[00:39:53.400] It took us out again to Germany.  \n",
      "[00:39:58.400] We didn't have, we didn't have,  we didn't have to go, not to go,  but everybody went, I was standing with maybe,  I don't know, 300 women in the German vatsters  to go off the train.  \n",
      "[00:40:13.400] I saw Germans from front, the red cross.  \n",
      "[00:40:18.400] We could run away, they wouldn't do nothing to us.  \n",
      "[00:40:21.400] We could be free the same night,  because we were shooting, other, just...  \n",

      "[00:40:41.400] We went to Germany and I don't think so.  \n",
      "[00:40:44.400] A quarter was alive after that.  \n",
      "[00:40:48.400] A quarter maybe was alive from all of us people.  \n",
      "[00:40:52.400] Good could run away, so easy.  \n",
      "[00:40:55.400] The same night, the Russian came in there.  \n",

      "[00:41:06.400] I have a method, I'm not running, I'm not volunteer.  \n",
      "[00:41:10.400] The last ones are the first...  \n",
      "[00:41:15.400] The first...  \n",
      "[00:41:17.400] The girls, they took, they shaved them, they didn't close.  \n",
      "[00:41:21.400] We didn't see them coming out, we came in at the frontway,  we went out, when they came to us they didn't have any clothes.  \n",
      "[00:41:28.400] Anymore.  \n",
      "[00:41:29.400] So we took a shower, they didn't shave us already.  \n",
      "[00:41:33.400] We had the same clothes, it was in January.  \n",
      "[00:41:40.400] So we stayed there in Bergenbund, it was in Bergenbund.  \n",
      "[00:41:46.400] Bergenbund was a...  \n",
      "[00:41:49.400] They say, Fenichtegumski.  \n",
      "[00:41:52.400] You didn't have work there.  \n",
      "[00:41:54.400] They catch you to work, but nothing.  \n",
      "[00:41:56.400] We used to carry bags to this, nothing.  \n",
      "[00:42:01.400] I remember one time they caught me to work in my younger sister.  \n",
      "[00:42:05.400] It was in January in Poland, it was very cold, very cold.  \n",
      "[00:42:10.400] So she carried a bed, I and that in the hand, I crossed into the bed.  \n",
      "[00:42:17.400] She said to me, I cannot go anymore, I cannot go anymore.  \n",
      "[00:42:21.400] I took a hand in my mouth and I blown, they got...  \n",
      "[00:42:26.400] So I took a scarf, I don't know what's happening, I put it in my hand,  she said, but we stayed there a month.  \n",
      "[00:42:32.400] Oh, we stayed another few weeks, we left.  \n",
      "[00:42:37.400] So they sent us out from Bergenbund, I remember two times, I think.  \n",
      "[00:42:46.400] There was two, Fenichtegumski, nothing, there was no work there.  \n",
      "[00:42:51.400] The barracks were in the basement, in the basement, the main, there were the slurred.  \n",
      "[00:43:00.400] We stayed there a month or two, from there we marched to Burga.  \n",
      "[00:43:07.400] This is by Dachau.  \n",
      "[00:43:11.400] There was, Burga was, plain factor in Burga.  \n",
      "[00:43:18.400] In Burga already they took us to barracks, it was clean,  and I could go for food, I mean, but five o'clock we have to get up,  they took us with buses, to the factory, to the planes in Augsburg, in the forest.  \n",
      "[00:43:37.400] I thought I was on a job now, I'd make lots of money.  \n",
      "[00:43:40.400] They took, I was always told, my age, so they took me in another year,  she's now in Toronto, to paint the plane, two years inside to put everything,  small paints, this wasn't for us, there was no very good thing, they were attacked.  \n",
      "[00:44:00.400] She used to make, she used to paint, the tap was brown, I used to paint blue, the body.  \n",
      "[00:44:11.400] Then I used to make spots with a, like a pistol, the paint with a,  here a spot, here a spot like, they are in the forest, they shouldn't show it,  truth, brown, here brown, here a spot, here a, so I used to work with them for a month.  \n",
      "[00:44:28.400] Over there, the cops told us, when you work with this, they used to have,  they give you special food and everything, but I was glad you went away,  we got a portion bread and everything, after this, this was our...  March, like a dead march.  \n",
      "[00:44:55.400] There were many girls, they couldn't walk anymore, they couldn't,  we were all full, you know, we saved a piece of bread, we saved this,  and we got a cover, we marched towards Dachau, Allah, there was a,  it was a bit cramped, it was already in April, in April,  in my system, my undisistered, couldn't walk anymore, so I hold on, my shoulder at the time,  and she couldn't, couldn't it?  \n",
      "[00:45:29.400] So, a horse and a boga came and they took the, the sick people, it was already at cross,  it was already at the end of April, no, I could finally remember,  that's why she couldn't walk, we slept on a ditch, the ditches are big,  three times in this house, very deep, in the water was there,  and we got a cover, and it was pouring, it's,  a sluptor on my, we got drenched wet, and when we got up,  my sister was already very sick, she couldn't walk,  so there was a horse and boga, in the two, can they took it to Dachau to hospital?  \n",
      "[00:46:08.400] This wasn't fucking Dachau, it was all over,  us three walked, and my undisistered, got sick, she walked,  and we both, me, my undisistered, carried him, by hand.  \n",
      "[00:46:26.400] Finally we came to Allah, and we heard already that it's not,  it's already the Americans are here already, we knew already,  it's the end, because they didn't hit us, they didn't shoot us.  \n",
      "[00:46:41.400] So, I slept on a table because I heard it was already,  and my sister went away to the hospital, and I was just very sick,  and the following day my undisistered, wanted to hospital, he got typhus.  \n",
      "[00:47:03.400] The shooting was there, night and day, night and day,  a two-day slider, the America's gym, a two-day slider.  \n",
      "[00:47:15.400] Then many people died, many people, because they give us food,  and for my undisistered, not you, not you.  \n",
      "[00:47:28.400] So, when the Americans came, they said,  my undisistered, she got better, so I asked,  about my sister, that they found out that she's Dachau in the hospital.  \n",
      "[00:47:39.400] She was, she was better.  \n",
      "[00:47:45.400] Then they took us, from Allah, we stayed there not too long,  there was a big, we stayed, and they took us from there,  I think, to Fremont, this is Bamiunik, because there was very good thing  that it was, and I was very sick.  \n",
      "[00:48:06.400] In Fremont, this was a two-course area, and there was,  I remember, during the war, 7,000 soldiers, German soldiers,  so big, not barracks, big buildings,  and the front was smaller building for all the officers in the high and elite,  so there was 80 women there, so we stayed there.  \n",
      "[00:48:34.400] And from there, the people used to go already from different camps.  \n",
      "[00:48:40.400] With a list, it's shown the front because it was a quarantine,  because the tide was big.  \n",
      "[00:48:47.400] With a list, who is alive?  \n",
      "[00:48:50.400] My youngest sister said, I liked the fall,  she said that she was dreaming that my brother alive.  \n",
      "[00:48:57.400] I remember, she said, I said, maybe,  the fall of the Agal camp feels from Krakow,  and he showed us all this, and it's on her brother's nose.  \n",
      "[00:49:07.400] And he said that he's going to two different camps,  and see people, and if somebody from us want to go see him,  you're more than welcome, he's going to take us.  \n",
      "[00:49:21.400] So my youngest sister went with my older,  and we took them, they had my brother there, this was,  and she had many years of Austrian boven.  \n",
      "[00:49:35.400] My brother was, they went out from Buchenwald,  1600 people, there was 104, 155 people here.  \n",
      "[00:49:44.400] This, so then they came back, and you all fell away.  \n",
      "[00:49:52.400] When I saw my brother, it was both with Agal.  \n",
      "[00:49:57.400] So, good looking, I scaled it.  \n",
      "[00:50:02.400] But they, they have nurses there,  they feed him, they give him medication.  \n",
      "[00:50:09.400] He was sick for a very long time.  \n",
      "[00:50:13.400] I remember they came to, they caught assessments,  and they brought him in, and my brother was laying in a better,  he said, come on, come on, hit him.  \n",
      "[00:50:26.400] It's funny now, when I think back, even down from,  but he crawled.  \n",
      "[00:50:32.400] He could hit, he was, before the war, I don't know,  laid him, how many pan could he weigh now?  \n",
      "[00:50:40.400] 150 pan.  \n",
      "[00:50:42.400] 150 pan, he was 80 pan, then.  \n",
      "[00:50:46.400] Yeah, he was told, so he crawled, crawled,  and he went to the facility, and he couldn't even go back,  to his back, because it's too much energy,  he couldn't make it.  \n",
      "[00:50:59.400] So, then he used to go, my brother, I went to,  lots and lots of hospitals.  \n",
      "[00:51:05.400] Nothing's coming, he's okay.  \n",
      "[00:51:09.400] I'm going to go back a little bit, back to,  when you were, before you were taking out your fillage.  \n",
      "[00:51:18.400] What happened to the schools in the family?  \n",
      "[00:51:21.400] They are closed right away.  \n",
      "[00:51:23.400] Yeah, they're closed.  \n",
      "[00:51:25.400] Of course, people were afraid to go.  \n",
      "[00:51:27.400] They were very nice youth communities.  \n",
      "[00:51:32.400] Very nice.  \n",
      "[00:51:34.400] Nice and friendly, I'm right to people, to Israel now.  \n",
      "[00:51:39.400] To my home town, yes?  \n",
      "[00:51:41.400] Did you need a camparitan to get food and to work?  \n",
      "[00:51:46.400] Yeah, yeah.  \n",
      "[00:51:47.400] Who worked?  \n",
      "[00:51:48.400] They didn't let us.  \n",
      "[00:51:49.400] There wasn't a working time, business.  \n",
      "[00:51:53.400] Everybody was told, business, most.  \n",
      "[00:51:57.400] But as we didn't have a thread, my brother came here,  he didn't have a thread.  \n",
      "[00:52:01.400] He was business, everything was business.  \n",
      "[00:52:06.400] What happened to the Starbucks?  \n",
      "[00:52:09.400] You know, the Germans came in today, let's you worship it more?  \n",
      "[00:52:12.400] No.  \n",
      "[00:52:14.400] All when they, they cut people to the roof,  my father had a beer.  \n",
      "[00:52:21.400] Not peace, just to be cut.  \n",
      "[00:52:23.400] They didn't let them.  \n",
      "[00:52:24.400] They see somebody with those locks, they cut them, they hit them.  \n",
      "[00:52:29.400] Once, they heard from the Germans, they came in.  \n",
      "[00:52:34.400] My father went to the city, I don't know, he went to pray, he came home.  \n",
      "[00:52:40.400] And on the way home, two Germans holding,  and tried to cut these beer and they hit me.  \n",
      "[00:52:48.400] Somebody, I was in the house, my brother.  \n",
      "[00:52:52.400] Somebody came to me and said, they cut me father.  \n",
      "[00:52:54.400] I went over and out, and tried to protect my father, they hit us.  \n",
      "[00:52:59.400] He told my father, let me show you what could be here.  \n",
      "[00:53:04.400] Oh, it was.  \n",
      "[00:53:07.400] It was on the beer again.  \n",
      "[00:53:11.400] When they, once they get out, did you stay in your home,  or were you sent to another house?  \n",
      "[00:53:18.400] No, they took me, they took with them before they fell.  \n",
      "[00:53:22.400] My mother was there.  \n",
      "[00:53:26.400] I met her later in the camp, she told me.  \n",
      "[00:53:29.400] She was to the last day, to the end.  \n",
      "[00:53:31.400] When they took the ghetto, then they took all the Jewish people,  or slushed out of them, they took boggies, they told them they were going to horse boggies,  they told them they were going to take him to concentration camps.  \n",
      "[00:53:47.400] My sister, my younger sister, my little brother, and my mother.  \n",
      "[00:53:55.400] My father, my mother, my sister, screamed to my sister.  \n",
      "[00:54:00.400] She was the young, nothing else.  \n",
      "[00:54:05.400] Because the people were done, they knew, they heard, they took,  they should push my sister down from the go, go hide something,  go because if not you go with us.  \n",
      "[00:54:22.400] And somebody gave me regards from me, and took.  \n",
      "[00:54:27.400] And this was in love, this is my panic, I think.  \n",
      "[00:54:32.400] That is so my mother holding my little brother, my sister.  \n",
      "[00:54:39.400] This woman was in camp with my sister, and then they killed her too,  because she was still old like my mother couldn't even let him go.  \n",
      "[00:54:49.400] This was the last thing that I heard.  \n",
      "[00:54:51.400] My father ran away, and they shot him.  \n",
      "[00:54:56.400] My younger sister, Hussula.  \n",
      "[00:54:59.400] She wasn't there, she wasn't there.  \n",
      "[00:55:05.400] So you're talking about the pulse, we have neighbors, the Inuitas.  \n",
      "[00:55:12.400] My father begged him to take my sister, when the German took over  the house, she went to our neighbor.  \n",
      "[00:55:21.400] She stayed there in the stable with cows, with everything.  \n",
      "[00:55:26.400] They didn't let her one night, she went from one stable to the house.  \n",
      "[00:55:32.400] So she went to the house, this is in Kelsen at Farfah Mass.  \n",
      "[00:55:37.400] So she went with other, there was a Jewish president who had,  so they took all the people, they sent them there.  \n",
      "[00:55:48.400] They didn't want to keep it.  \n",
      "[00:55:51.400] You talk about the poor.  \n",
      "[00:55:54.400] Did you call, was there a youth match in the ghetto?  \n",
      "[00:56:05.400] Oh, by a, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.  \n",
      "[00:56:11.400] How did they operate?  \n",
      "[00:56:15.400] I had an nephew, he's in Toronto, he was hiding by the pulse.  \n",
      "[00:56:21.400] Where is she?  \n",
      "[00:56:24.400] So who was already 15 times thrown in the shot?  \n",
      "[00:56:28.400] He was young then, he was his brother.  \n",
      "[00:56:33.400] They forced you.  \n",
      "[00:56:36.400] What could you do?\n",
      "[00:56:36.400] You have to go with the dogs.  \n",
      "[00:56:41.400] You didn't want to go, they bite you.  \n",
      "[00:56:44.400] And they took you there, let's go.  \n",
      "[00:56:47.400] I wasn't to the last minute, I wasn't to come here before.  \n",
      "[00:56:51.400] There's so much of an enthral movement.  \n",
      "[00:56:54.400] By ask, yeah, scarves, scarves?  \n",
      "[00:56:58.400] I have a friend in scarves, scarves.  \n",
      "[00:57:02.400] She came from Lorsch, from the big cities,  when they formed the ghetto, lots of people came to small towns.  \n",
      "[00:57:09.400] They thought the Germans wouldn't go.  \n",
      "[00:57:13.400] So I met her there by ask.  \n",
      "[00:57:16.400] She walked the ammunition,  we start the one-barre, the ammunition, the definition.  \n",
      "[00:57:27.400] She used to steal the ammunition.  \n",
      "[00:57:30.400] Nobody knew.  \n",
      "[00:57:33.400] Nobody knew.  \n",
      "[00:57:34.400] I know two guys, the repolishment,  they belong to the underground, there, because...  The reactor is there, it's scarves, it's scarves.  \n",
      "[00:57:45.400] For us.  \n",
      "[00:57:48.400] So she, smaller, unannounced now, finished, and she gave it.  \n",
      "[00:57:52.400] We didn't know, nobody, from us.  \n",
      "[00:57:56.400] One day she didn't come home from work.  \n",
      "[00:58:00.400] The repolishment, the city sink, all night,  polished some, the Germans some.  \n",
      "[00:58:07.400] The cutter, steal it, get shot at.  \n",
      "[00:58:11.400] For that, she shot at her, but it was an underground.  \n",
      "[00:58:14.400] That's what, since then, she found out it was an underground.  \n",
      "[00:58:25.400] Was there much smuggling in the ghetto to get food in?  \n",
      "[00:58:29.400] Oh, yeah.  \n",
      "[00:58:31.400] The plants who worked there, smuggling, and they sold,  who got...  People who had money, people who came  from the St. Paul, scarves, there's a pan.  \n",
      "[00:58:43.400] And this was out of the town, the factors.  \n",
      "[00:58:48.400] So they could take everything, because they came before us,  but they asked, they took it without nothing.  \n",
      "[00:58:57.400] So we came in, for us, it was very poor, the skin, very poor skin.  \n",
      "[00:59:04.400] Oh, many, many.  \n",
      "[00:59:06.400] The first time, and they shoot us, the second day,  but few guys, young guys, they went to be to school,  or several of them, they ran away.  \n",
      "[00:59:15.400] They brought them, they followed in their calculations.  \n",
      "[00:59:18.400] Oh, so...  \n",
      "[00:59:23.400] Why didn't he have a word to go?  \n",
      "[00:59:29.400] Two people had any idea of the death camp,  did they, did anyone ever get back to your town?  \n",
      "[00:59:36.400] What was happening?  \n",
      "[00:59:40.400] It was before they took us, a guy ran away from a train.  \n",
      "[00:59:47.400] He's brother, look by us, in the same building.  \n",
      "[00:59:51.400] And he said that he had a sword,  something but nobody believes.  \n",
      "[01:00:00.400] Remember my father had a Bible, he said,  no, God has nothing, love to have you.  \n",
      "[01:00:05.400] No, not to us.  \n",
      "[01:00:09.400] Then we'll start hearing lots of things,  because they took from us, people, they took my brother,  they sent him to be a livestock, for work.  \n",
      "[01:00:17.400] Then when he came, he told us horrible stones.  \n",
      "[01:00:23.400] Yeah,\n",
      "[01:00:23.400] but still nobody could believe it.  \n",
      "[01:00:27.400] I myself don't believe that.  \n",
      "[01:00:30.400] There are so many nice people by the last day,  they took them, I don't know.  \n",
      "[01:00:36.400] There was a guy, they had factories from...  Long beyond, different, very religious,  and they took him, I don't know, I saw him.  \n",
      "[01:00:51.400] They were married already,  we were always single again.  \n",
      "[01:00:57.400] And he came in when I saw him, I gosh, I couldn't believe it.  \n",
      "[01:01:02.400] They didn't live like that, I don't know.  \n",
      "[01:01:05.400] They couldn't exist, couldn't exist.  \n",
      "[01:01:09.400] If I would be by myself, I would live in this for two months.  \n",
      "[01:01:15.400] But I was with my sister, she's more energetic than me,  because I didn't care.  \n",
      "[01:01:22.400] I remember, I dreamed the first week,  I just wanted to be with my brother.  \n",
      "[01:01:28.400] If they're there, I wouldn't be there.  \n",
      "[01:01:31.400] They take you away from a home, you raise,  you love each other so much.  \n",
      "[01:01:40.400] No, one person, and they were alone, they couldn't survive.  \n",
      "[01:01:44.400] Very hard.  \n",
      "[01:01:48.400] In the camp, the first place you were taken to,  I can't remember, I was taken to...  Very hard, very hard.  \n",
      "[01:02:00.400] What could the actual living conditions like the barracks  and the food, do you?  \n",
      "[01:02:08.400] The food, very poor, couldn't it?  \n",
      "[01:02:13.400] If you don't, people who worked in the ammunition,  they try to make a portion bread,  or a little soup, by washing clothes for somebody.  \n",
      "[01:02:27.400] By doing certain chores for somebody who had no money,  there was a deal, she was my agent from Alhantar,  and the master, my master from the hospital,  took a sheet of clean dishes,  she was like a queen, to clean the house,  she got food and everything that she used to bring food.  \n",
      "[01:02:52.400] She died there,\n",
      "[00:00:00.000] oh my gosh, if you were sick,  they'd take you out to the forest, but I was lucky.  \n",
      "[01:03:02.400] I went in Scottish, and I went to wash myself there,  there were a few things, water, and I fainted.  \n",
      "[01:03:17.400] They took me to work in Scottish megatimes.  \n",
      "[01:03:24.400] My brother was still there,  because we saved him, when he was there, we were never ready.  \n",
      "[01:03:32.400] But when he was in the ammunition,  he was working, we saved the eight, one portion bread,  for both of us.  \n",
      "[01:03:40.400] So I got sick, and I took him there, my brother,  found out, I remember right now, he saw his portion bread,  and he brought some place, all.  \n",
      "[01:03:50.400] He brought him, bro.  \n",
      "[01:03:53.400] And there, the hospital was salty, dead people.  \n",
      "[01:04:00.400] I would never do it at all, so I could leave.  \n",
      "[01:04:04.400] I said, I beg your please eat.  \n",
      "[01:04:08.400] He said no, please, they didn't let him in,  but somehow he begged the nurse, they let him in.  \n",
      "[01:04:15.400] Next to me was I came from Scottish, she died, it was not.  \n",
      "[01:04:19.400] But from our work,  be where I was, there were Jewish people,  the ship from the camp, there was a woman, a woman,  I remember like that, she came to visit me,  and I came to her today, I just told my husband a few months ago.  \n",
      "[01:04:40.400] I think our master, the folks there,  sent her.  \n",
      "[01:04:47.400] Because she wouldn't go, what did she have?  \n",
      "[01:04:50.400] She came, she asked me, she told them to give me medication  or something, and I survived.  \n",
      "[01:04:57.400] She brought me home, I remember she came to visit me,  she asked me how I...  \n",
      "[01:05:03.400] This is something like an angel would come to you.  \n",
      "[01:05:06.400] This filthy would straw every minute they took out dead bodies.  \n",
      "[01:05:11.400] And I went home with all the girls who worked in this camp,  took me home, and I went to work,  my sister worked for me, I could work, I couldn't work.  \n",
      "[01:05:24.400] But I have to go, if not, they will be ships,  they catch you in barang, sick, they came lots of times.  \n",
      "[01:05:32.400] But they brought me home, a few days later I couldn't go down from that.  \n",
      "[01:05:38.400] But somebody heard that it's going to be,  they're going to come, the Germans received, somebody's sick.  \n",
      "[01:05:51.400] So two girls came from the night ship, they slept during the day.  \n",
      "[01:05:55.400] They took me out in the love of somebody.  \n",
      "[01:05:58.400] They took me out.  \n",
      "[01:05:59.400] It does two girls, one girl, is in Toronto and one is in southern America, two sisters.  \n",
      "[01:06:04.400] They took me out, they used to be friends with my brother.  \n",
      "[01:06:10.400] They used to come to us, they came, they took me out.  \n",
      "[01:06:13.400] After they left, the inspection, they took me out.  \n",
      "[01:06:18.400] See, there is, I don't know, I see there is a God.  \n",
      "[01:06:23.400] And I believe, strongly, really, sometimes I say,  there would be a God, there are many people,  listen, people got killed for what?  \n",
      "[01:06:31.400] What?  \n",
      "[01:06:32.400] A child do wrong.  \n",
      "[01:06:36.400] But then there are miracles, you see, everywhere, you see, there are miracles in miracles.  \n",
      "[01:06:46.400] Did the issue you're clothing there, or did you?  \n",
      "[01:06:50.400] No, what kind of God?  \n",
      "[01:06:53.400] You have to, you sold, you brought a lot of clothes, I couldn't.  \n",
      "[01:06:58.400] Once they brought clothes, from other that people probably,  they shot in an eagreot to alkim.  \n",
      "[01:07:09.400] And they put them on the ground, it was, I don't remember, sauna, outside,  and they told us to go out from all the barracks.  \n",
      "[01:07:19.400] They said, they come to three, later I found out,  everybody go and grab, but I couldn't go out.  \n",
      "[01:07:25.400] I didn't care.  \n",
      "[01:07:28.400] Some I sister cried, cried, because I know friends of my there and out  and brought three fatheresses of this, all they could live,  or pens or shoes, socks, anything, from that people, of course.  \n",
      "[01:07:41.400] But I told my sister, she's now no one, I said,  I couldn't go, I said, I was right, I was, you know,  I kind of like this, you don't care, you don't care,  if you are alive or if you don't, they brought in,  I remember, brought in clothes, my sister brought to the recess of this,  and she said, you see, you could go, you could help,  my brother, I said, listen, I get my breath,  I send it to my brother, I go on a gilletay,  but they don't give us clothes, no.  \n",
      "[01:08:14.400] People saw this, so, when we walked in scarletous comets,  so the pills from the potatoes, we threw it out,  this one for the pigs.  \n",
      "[01:08:32.400] So people went through, and they tried to grab us to eat,  all the other, the other Germans, they could shot him.  \n",
      "[01:08:43.400] They beat him to death, they did nothing,  from when I worked at an ice ship.  \n",
      "[01:08:54.400] So if you have a potato, as we took, we got in big canister soup.  \n",
      "[01:08:59.400] So it was 11 o'clock, we got a break,  and we could drink the soup, and nobody from us, they eat the soup.  \n",
      "[01:09:05.400] Of course, the pills they got potatoes, they saw they have a piece of bread,  and the soup, it was impossible to eat.  \n",
      "[01:09:12.400] Of course for us, but for our not for others.  \n",
      "[01:09:15.400] So I used to take a canister soup into the barracks at night.  \n",
      "[01:09:25.400] I remember, and I came in, it was 11 o'clock until everybody was souping.  \n",
      "[01:09:31.400] The pills ran out from the crew, from the...  and everybody had it, put everybody out of the crew.  \n",
      "[01:09:40.400] When I worked at a night ship, I almost did it, I almost did it.  \n",
      "[01:09:44.400] There were Jewish policemen, you know, I know already, and I told them.  \n",
      "[01:09:49.400] They were good, and they were bad too, it was very bad, one day.  \n",
      "[01:09:53.400] They sent them away later.  \n",
      "[01:09:56.400] I came with two men, half soup, and the woman, by us, we have soup.  \n",
      "[01:10:03.400] I told them to give us the soup.  \n",
      "[01:10:07.400] So they give us the soup, so I took a canister here.  \n",
      "[01:10:11.400] Not a canister, they don't like this.  \n",
      "[01:10:15.400] And I put a coat over, nobody sees, I hold here, and I go like this.  \n",
      "[01:10:22.400] So this policeman was standing by, and he was standing with us, he slept me long, and twice.  \n",
      "[01:10:29.400] He slept me so hard, but I begged him, and I cried.  \n",
      "[01:10:34.400] I went back to the room.  \n",
      "[01:10:36.400] But then he went away, so...  \n",
      "[01:10:40.400] But most of the Jewish people, they let you through, because they know.  \n",
      "[01:10:47.400] I think that we're in church, if you're actually lack of record, out of the stairs, is it carposts?  \n",
      "[01:10:55.400] No, by us.  \n",
      "[01:10:58.400] It wasn't...  \n",
      "[01:11:01.400] They arranged from each baroque one should vouch, or by the devil, of course.  \n",
      "[01:11:07.400] But us was a small, not too big.  \n",
      "[01:11:11.400] Of course it was a lack of this, it was a human, a rena, that only she was.  \n",
      "[01:11:20.400] Did they keep the sex as separate, the men through the women, or the individual?  \n",
      "[01:11:26.400] There was one baroque, if somebody was rich, I mean, to the father.  \n",
      "[01:11:34.400] Our baroque was divided.  \n",
      "[01:11:40.400] There was, she was a Jewish, she was taking care, very intelligent woman.  \n",
      "[01:11:46.400] The Terhaz bin, staying in the baroque, it was divided.  \n",
      "[01:11:51.400] And there were certain barons, you met, you could live there.  \n",
      "[01:11:57.400] Or if you have money, you reach, you have a boyfriend, you could.  \n",
      "[01:12:01.400] Very few, very few, who could think of a tenka?  \n",
      "[01:12:07.400] Did you have trouble getting to see your brother, getting in to...  No, don't do that.  \n",
      "[01:12:15.400] Night, or night?  \n",
      "[01:12:18.400] Don't do that.  \n",
      "[01:12:20.400] We arranged so that one, if my brother works through the day, I'll stay with him the day,  my sister went at night, because we changed ships.  \n",
      "[01:12:33.400] We used to walk together, but when I brought my brother, so...  One was always with my brother, we watched it.  \n",
      "[01:12:42.400] Not that he needed watching, but we cooked something for him, we see.  \n",
      "[01:12:46.400] That he could eat.  \n",
      "[01:12:49.400] Did you count the names of any of the Germans who were in charge of the day?  \n",
      "[01:12:55.400] Can't you read?  \n",
      "[01:12:58.400] Of course.  \n",
      "[01:13:00.400] He had not lived in Krausek.  \n",
      "[01:13:04.400] They shot one, one, they shot him.  \n",
      "[01:13:07.400] Or going home, he was with Polish woman.  \n",
      "[01:13:12.400] They said the party doesn't say, well, nobody knew.  \n",
      "[01:13:19.400] I remember, it was 1942, because maybe 1943,  we didn't have work by us in the middle of...  \n",
      "[01:13:32.400] Our master, his name is Laskovski, was...  \n",
      "[01:13:36.400] He was a folkstarch.  \n",
      "[01:13:38.400] He sent us to the Ammonition Factory for a couple months, until the potato sugar.  \n",
      "[01:13:47.400] And he lied, or heard, and I don't even recall by whom I walked.  \n",
      "[01:13:53.400] Ammonition, they sent us to transport.  \n",
      "[01:13:58.400] Many used to work by this.  \n",
      "[01:14:01.400] So they took us to pick up a crate of Ammonition, even farmen could pick this.  \n",
      "[01:14:10.400] I worked there for the months.  \n",
      "[01:14:14.400] He wouldn't call us big.  \n",
      "[01:14:18.400] Before the war, they told us they took on a roll,  a special wedding or work, they wrote this.  \n",
      "[01:14:24.400] But then they got a labour for nothing.  \n",
      "[01:14:26.400] The men used to work.  \n",
      "[01:14:28.400] But when we didn't have work, they sent us there.  \n",
      "[01:14:31.400] So they took us to create.  \n",
      "[01:14:35.400] We worked there, I don't know.  \n",
      "[01:14:37.400] Six weeks, I don't know even if two months.  \n",
      "[01:14:41.400] I don't think so, could survive two months.  \n",
      "[01:14:45.400] So that's why I know I worked by...  \n",
      "[01:14:48.400] I think herring was...  \n",
      "[01:14:51.400] Two inches, four inches, and polished centimetre.  \n",
      "[01:14:57.400] The shells, all kind of.  \n",
      "[01:14:59.400] They used to put in a crate.  \n",
      "[01:15:02.400] This is very heavy.  \n",
      "[01:15:03.400] We used to carry this.  \n",
      "[01:15:06.400] Pick this up, put this on the table.  \n",
      "[01:15:08.400] And people used to check it.  \n",
      "[01:15:10.400] It could have a syphilis, it could have a gout or not.  \n",
      "[01:15:17.400] You were there for how long?  \n",
      "[01:15:20.400] In the first year.  \n",
      "[01:15:23.400] First came, probably years.  \n",
      "[01:15:25.400] Almost two years.  \n",
      "[01:15:28.400] When the Russian came in,  they came here, they vacated.  \n",
      "[01:15:35.400] That was a four four.  \n",
      "[01:15:37.400] Yeah.  \n",
      "[01:15:40.400] When you were there, they took you by train,  but did you have a two-go train?  \n",
      "[01:15:46.400] Train, because it's train, they lock.  \n",
      "[01:15:50.400] How long were you there?\n",
      "[00:00:00.000] How long were you on a train?  \n",
      "[01:15:54.400] On us trains.  \n",
      "[01:15:58.400] They took us several times on trains.  \n",
      "[01:16:01.400] To Germany took us long, because it's not big.  \n",
      "[01:16:06.400] It's from Skorysko, ours maybe.  \n",
      "[01:16:09.400] But from chance to hunt up to Germany took us long.  \n",
      "[01:16:18.400] They gave us some bread, for things.  \n",
      "[01:16:21.400] And days, days, remembering,  Bertsburg, Germany.  \n",
      "[01:16:27.400] Between Stadard and Nitasalt.  \n",
      "[01:16:30.400] And they were the bombs fell all over.  \n",
      "[01:16:34.400] All of them, we prayed it.  \n",
      "[01:16:37.400] We didn't care.  \n",
      "[01:16:39.400] We died, but days, days took us.  \n",
      "[01:16:43.400] Because you couldn't go all the time.  \n",
      "[01:16:46.400] And then they let us out from the train, on a box.  \n",
      "[01:16:51.400] In Germany, I cannot recall where it was.  \n",
      "[01:16:58.400] And I saw a silver place,  but they didn't throw bombs.  \n",
      "[01:17:04.400] They glared, we waited to them, they should throw bombs.  \n",
      "[01:17:07.400] They did.  \n",
      "[01:17:10.400] It was already at the end.  \n",
      "[01:17:17.400] How many people were in a train car?  \n",
      "[01:17:21.400] We were all.  \n",
      "[01:17:23.400] You couldn't move, tied.  \n",
      "[01:17:28.400] And then we could go.  \n",
      "[01:17:31.400] We couldn't see, we couldn't.  \n",
      "[01:17:34.400] So many ways.  \n",
      "[01:17:37.400] We didn't try any sanitary facilities,  was there a bucket?  \n",
      "[01:17:43.400] No.  We had a cellar tied in the forest at night.  \n",
      "[01:17:51.400] It's the same.  \n",
      "[01:17:52.400] When they brought us to Bergen-Beldinger,  we had one room.  \n",
      "[01:17:58.400] A big room.  \n",
      "[01:18:01.400] Let us stay, lay at night during the day.  \n",
      "[01:18:05.400] If you want to stay out of your vehicle,  just a small space station.  \n",
      "[01:18:12.400] A little small space.  \n",
      "[01:18:16.400] I wasn't too long.  \n",
      "[01:18:18.400] I was one month, but I was.  \n",
      "[01:18:21.400] There you couldn't stay long.  \n",
      "[01:18:23.400] We came in, got the worst of it.  \n",
      "[01:18:26.400] People who are already there for a long time,  they know how to do it.  \n",
      "[01:18:31.400] You could see a pass by Bergen-Beldinger,  you see mountains shoes, mountains of clothes,  mountains of clothes.  \n",
      "[01:18:41.400] I went back after the war,  and I went back.  \n",
      "[01:18:47.400] Not that I wanted, but I had the look for his money.  \n",
      "[01:18:50.400] I was like a little bit.  \n",
      "[01:18:53.400] That's why I would never go back to Berlin.  \n",
      "[01:18:56.400] Never go back to Berlin.  \n",

      "[01:23:58.400] Not a rain, it was...  \n",
      "[01:24:00.400] I thought we would get up and nobody would do a life.  \n",
      "[01:24:06.400] Because it's...  After this I remember that so many people got sick.  \n",
      "[01:24:12.400] And then we marched the day, we marched at night.  \n",
      "[01:24:14.400] And at night you see so many people marching back and marching for them.  \n",
      "[01:24:18.400] They could fall.  \n",

      "[01:24:54.400] He came down.  \n",
      "[01:24:56.400] He saw him, he did...  \n",
      "[01:24:58.400] He didn't have the water.\n",
      "[01:25:00.400] So he went down.  \n",

      "[00:00:00.000] 10 cigars.  \n",
      "[00:00:00.000] My brother, maybe he felt sorry for him because my brother had his hand with bandages.  \n",
      "[01:25:22.400] So there are still people who had money and he will have a bread or something.  \n",
      "[00:00:00.000] So that was his alive.  \n",
      "[00:00:00.000] From the 10 cigars.  \n",
      "[01:25:26.400] So 10 cigars what do you have?  \n",
      "[01:25:34.400] Is there any kind of religious activity in the camps?  \n",
      "[01:25:36.400] And the barracks where you were?  \n",
      "[01:25:40.400] In the beginning when they took us out of Lebanon, it was Eastern.  \n",
      "[01:25:44.400] Lots of people remember.  \n",
      "[01:25:46.400] So they didn't eat bread.  \n",
      "[01:25:48.400] So they took it.  \n",
      "[01:25:50.400] So they showed them bread.  \n",
      "[01:25:52.400] So they took it.  \n",
      "[01:25:54.400] So they took it.  \n",
      "[01:25:56.400] I could never eat meat.  Meat.  \n",
      "[01:26:00.400] They didn't give us meat.  \n",
      "[01:26:02.400] Who would say meat?  \n",
      "[01:26:04.400] Special bars was a very good one.  \n",
      "[01:26:06.400] But they put maybe horse meat in the soup sometimes.  \n",
      "[01:26:10.400] I could not give it.  \n",
      "[01:26:12.400] I could not.  \n",
      "[01:26:14.400] Was there a difference between the SS and the barrack guards?  \n",
      "[01:26:20.400] Yes.  \n",
      "[01:26:22.400] Oh, a big hulk cross.  \n",
      "[01:26:24.400] But then we have them from Ukraine.  \n",
      "[01:26:28.400] Oh, they were so good.  \n",
      "[01:26:30.400] They didn't have the wrong arguments at the end.  \n",
      "[01:26:34.400] They had no idea.  \n",
      "[01:26:36.400] They had no idea.  \n",
      "[01:26:38.400] The Ukrainians were there.  \n",
      "[01:26:40.400] And then tell me about how you were liberated when you were at the end of the war?  \n",
      "[01:26:52.400] It was the Americans.  \n",
      "[01:26:54.400] Oh, Americans.  \n",
      "[01:26:58.400] We had shots and this was another.  \n",
      "[01:27:02.400] This is near Dacha.  \n",
      "[01:27:04.400] In my two sisters, very hospital and I was with my sister.  \n",
      "[01:27:08.400] They were sleeping on a table because they said the restores were ready.  \n",
      "[01:27:12.400] Fifteen everything.  \n",
      "[01:27:14.400] I didn't share that with her, but I like when I'm clean.  \n",
      "[01:27:18.400] So with her the shots on my two legs, through the barracks, and after people got killed.  \n",
      "[01:27:26.400] There was a hospital.  \n",
      "[01:27:28.400] They made for my barrack a hospital.  \n",
      "[01:27:31.400] In the morning, we didn't see one day.  \n",
      "[01:27:35.400] The women, the Germans, all, there were big shots as they couldn't even look at them.  \n",
      "[01:27:43.400] We didn't see anybody.  \n",
      "[01:27:47.400] Finally, the following day, they still didn't come in the same day.  \n",
      "[01:27:53.400] And I saw nurses, nurses, all of them.  \n",
      "[01:27:57.400] I forget it.  \n",
      "[01:27:59.400] Fingerlings.  \n",
      "[01:28:01.400] And they came around\n",
      "[01:28:01.400] and they were sitting in the dirt that you made sick.  \n",
      "[01:28:11.400] The dirty, I don't know if I could go there.  \n",
      "[01:28:15.400] She went to the bacteria.  \n",
      "[01:28:19.400] She mocked us to meet her.  \n",
      "[01:28:23.400] But then there was a French doctor.  \n",
      "[01:28:27.400] I used to know this name, but I don't remember.  \n",
      "[01:28:31.400] I have to ask my friends.  \n",
      "[01:28:34.400] He did so much.  \n",
      "[01:28:37.400] And there was a French archive from the concentration to...  \n",
      "[01:28:42.400] Maybe he worked in a hospital, he looked good.  \n",
      "[01:28:47.400] And he took a few deals from us who were not sick to help them.  \n",
      "[01:28:54.400] When the American people came in and I knew.  \n",
      "[01:28:58.400] And there was a home, barak home, maybe 316 people.  \n",
      "[01:29:05.400] So I wasn't another unit doctor to tell us to go away and assist him.  \n",
      "[01:29:09.400] And nothing, what did I know?  \n",
      "[01:29:13.400] So I saw he...  Give a shot, I said it myself.  \n",
      "[01:29:18.400] He couldn't.  \n",
      "[01:29:19.400] Yeah,\n",
      "[01:29:19.400] but he told me to do certain things I didn't.  \n",
      "[01:29:22.400] And he was an intern.  \n",
      "[01:29:24.400] This guy was an intern.  \n",
      "[01:29:26.400] I hope they did.  \n",
      "[01:29:28.400] Not too many people.  \n",
      "[01:29:30.400] I have a Jewish guy, a French.  \n",
      "[01:29:34.400] He was a few French people, but he did.  \n",
      "[01:29:37.400] And then the one thing that they did wrong was they gave...  \n",
      "[01:29:43.400] Right away, food, food.  \n",
      "[01:29:46.400] Lots of people died, they couldn't take it.  \n",
      "[01:29:49.400] I'm going to give you a little food, you can take it.  \n",
      "[01:29:53.400] I'm going to just stay on that after these after you.\n",

      "This is by Dachau.   2587.4 2598.4\n",
      "There was, Burga was, plain factor in Burga.   2591.4 2603.4\n",
      "In Burga already they took us to barracks, it was clean,  and I could go for food, I mean, but five o'clock we have to get up,  they took us with buses, to the factory, to the planes in Augsburg, in the forest.   2598.4 2620.4\n",
      "I thought I was on a job now, I'd make lots of money.   2617.4 2626.4\n",
      "They took, I was always told, my age, so they took me in another year,  she's now in Toronto, to paint the plane, two years inside to put everything,  small paints, this wasn't for us, there was no very good thing, they were attacked.   2620.4 2651.4\n",
      "She used to make, she used to paint, the tap was brown, I used to paint blue, the body.   2640.4 2656.4\n",
      "Then I used to make spots with a, like a pistol, the paint with a,  here a spot, here a spot like, they are in the forest, they shouldn't show it,  truth, brown, here brown, here a spot, here a, so I used to work with them for a month.   2651.4 2674.4\n",
      "Over there, the cops told us, when you work with this, they used to have,  they give you special food and everything, but I was glad you went away,  we got a portion bread and everything, after this, this was our...  March, like a dead march.   2668.4 2700.4\n",
      "There were many girls, they couldn't walk anymore, they couldn't,  we were all full, you know, we saved a piece of bread, we saved this,  and we got a cover, we marched towards Dachau, Allah, there was a,  it was a bit cramped, it was already in April, in April,  in my system, my undisistered, couldn't walk anymore, so I hold on, my shoulder at the time,  and she couldn't, couldn't it?   2695.4 2736.4\n",
      "So, a horse and a boga came and they took the, the sick people, it was already at cross,  it was already at the end of April, no, I could finally remember,  that's why she couldn't walk, we slept on a ditch, the ditches are big,  three times in this house, very deep, in the water was there,  and we got a cover, and it was pouring, it's,  a sluptor on my, we got drenched wet, and when we got up,  my sister was already very sick, she couldn't walk,  so there was a horse and boga, in the two, can they took it to Dachau to hospital?   2729.4 2772.4\n",
      "This wasn't fucking Dachau, it was all over,  us three walked, and my undisistered, got sick, she walked,  and we both, me, my undisistered, carried him, by hand.   2768.4 2790.4\n",
      "Finally we came to Allah, and we heard already that it's not,  it's already the Americans are here already, we knew already,  it's the end, because they didn't hit us, they didn't shoot us.   2786.4 2808.4\n",
      "So, I slept on a table because I heard it was already,  and my sister went away to the hospital, and I was just very sick,  and the following day my undisistered, wanted to hospital, he got typhus.   2801.4 2828.4\n",
      "The shooting was there, night and day, night and day,  a two-day slider, the America's gym, a two-day slider.   2823.4 2842.4\n",
      "Then many people died, many people, because they give us food,  and for my undisistered, not you, not you.   2835.4 2851.4\n",
      "So, when the Americans came, they said,  my undisistered, she got better, so I asked,  about my sister, that they found out that she's Dachau in the hospital.   2848.4 2861.4\n",
      "She was, she was better.   2859.4 2870.4\n",
      "Then they took us, from Allah, we stayed there not too long,  there was a big, we stayed, and they took us from there,  I think, to Fremont, this is Bamiunik, because there was very good thing  that it was, and I was very sick.   2865.4 2889.4\n",
      "In Fremont, this was a two-course area, and there was,  I remember, during the war, 7,000 soldiers, German soldiers,  so big, not barracks, big buildings,  and the front was smaller building for all the officers in the high and elite,  so there was 80 women there, so we stayed there.   2886.4 2920.4\n",
      "And from there, the people used to go already from different camps.   2914.4 2924.4\n",
      "With a list, it's shown the front because it was a quarantine,  because the tide was big.   2920.4 2930.4\n",
      "With a list, who is alive?   2927.4 2933.4\n",
      "My youngest sister said, I liked the fall,  she said that she was dreaming that my brother alive.   2930.4 2939.4\n",
      "I remember, she said, I said, maybe,  the fall of the Agal camp feels from Krakow,  and he showed us all this, and it's on her brother's nose.   2937.4 2952.4\n",
      "And he said that he's going to two different camps,  and see people, and if somebody from us want to go see him,  you're more than welcome, he's going to take us.   2947.4 2965.4\n",
      "So my youngest sister went with my older,  and we took them, they had my brother there, this was,  and she had many years of Austrian boven.   2961.4 2978.4\n",
      "My brother was, they went out from Buchenwald,  1600 people, there was 104, 155 people here.   2975.4 2992.4\n",
      "This, so then they came back, and you all fell away.   2984.4 2997.4\n",
      "When I saw my brother, it was both with Agal.   2992.4 3002.4\n",
      "So, good looking, I scaled it.   2997.4 3006.4\n",
      "But they, they have nurses there,  they feed him, they give him medication.   3002.4 3013.4\n",
      "He was sick for a very long time.   3009.4 3017.4\n",
      "I remember they came to, they caught assessments,  and they brought him in, and my brother was laying in a better,  he said, come on, come on, hit him.   3013.4 3030.4\n",
      "It's funny now, when I think back, even down from,  but he crawled.   3026.4 3036.4\n",
      "He could hit, he was, before the war, I don't know,  laid him, how many pan could he weigh now?   3032.4 3042.4\n",
      "150 pan.   3040.4 3046.4\n",
      "150 pan, he was 80 pan, then.   3042.4 3049.4\n",
      "Yeah, he was told, so he crawled, crawled,  and he went to the facility, and he couldn't even go back,  to his back, because it's too much energy,  he couldn't make it.   3046.4 3062.4\n",
      "So, then he used to go, my brother, I went to,  lots and lots of hospitals.   3059.4 3069.4\n",
      "Nothing's coming, he's okay.   3065.4 3073.4\n",
      "I'm going to go back a little bit, back to,  when you were, before you were taking out your fillage.   3069.4 3081.4\n",
      "What happened to the schools in the family?   3078.4 3083.4\n",
      "They are closed right away.   3081.4 3085.4\n",
      "Yeah, they're closed.   3083.4 3087.4\n",
      "Of course, people were afraid to go.   3085.4 3092.4\n",
